        This document explains how you construct a good Emacs Lisp package.
        Document serves as a checklist where you can refer back after you
        have made your first lisp package. Check that are pieces are in
        their places. When the packages have more or less standard layout,
        other tools can be used to lint (verify the the structure) and find
        information from them. If package looks messy or feels like chaos,
        many people may skip over it.

        The order of importance

        .   Variable and function naming -- without this your package is messy.
        .   Correct first line      -- it helps getting right summaries
        .   'provide' command       -- don't ever leave it out
        .   Check code with Byte Compiler -- Nobody wants leaking code.
        .   Offer autoload choice   -- nobody wants to load all when
            emacs starts
        .   Use dynamic compilation -- reduces memory in 19.29+
        .   Version number          -- preferrably accessible from variable
        .   Correct keywords tag    -- See finder.el in Emacs distribution

2.0 Checklist items

    2.1 Select unique prefix for all functions and all variables

        Say, you have created package XXX.el, then all in it should
        be inform

            XXX-function1
            XXX-function2

            XXX-variable1
            XXX-variable2

        Some prefer naming the variables differently, like adding
        double dash or colon.

            XXX--variable1
            XXX--variable2

            XXX-:variable1
            XXX-:variable2

        This allows searching/replacing/grepping variables more
        easily. Whatever you choose, stick to it.

    2.2 Always include correct first line:

            ;;; file.el --- One line description string
            ^^^     ^^^
            |
            First line should use three comment marks, the rest
            of the documentation use only two.

    3.3 Put 'provide' command at the end of file

        If you want be backward compatible, do it like that. Up till 19.28
        there was a bug which didn't undo the definitions if error happened
        during the loading. --> the feature was "provided", when it really
        should had been wiped out due to errors. 19.29+ corrects the
        situation. In those, you can put provide at the beginning of your
        code. In some rare cases, you have to put provide to the beginning
        of file, so that the feature is "seen" to other packages that you
        load. This is needed if some package require "yours" too. Byte
        Compiler will tell you if there is such conflict in putting the
        require to the end.

    2.3 Check the code layout with lisp-mnt.el

        Use function `lm-verify'. It tells you if you have proper tags in
        your package. Pay attention to the count of comment markers with
        these lines:

            ;;; XXX.el --- proper first line

            ;; Author:
            ;; Maintainer:
            ;; Created:
            ;; Keywords:
            ;; X-YourField:

            ;;; Install:

            ;;; Commentary:

            ;;; Change Log:

            ;;; Code:

            ;;; XXX.el ends here

    2.4 Check the documentation strings which checkdoc.el

        In addition to `lm-verify', the checkdoc will parse all your
        variable and function documentation and show you the points
        where the documentation does not follow the conventions
        mentioned in the Emacs info page. There is also *checkdoc.el*
        which is distributed latest Emacs

            File: elisp, Node: Documentation Tips

    2.5 Check the code with Elint.el

        A lisp syntax checker is also your friend. Run it through your code
        and check code for unused variables and that functions are called
        with right arguments. You find this package also in latest Emacs
        distribution. If you don't have it, there may be small chance that
        you can get it from author Peter Liljenberg.

    2.6 Always include GNU copyright.

        See your emacs distribution and copy one from there
        and mention link http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html Here is
        the *de* *facto* standard for Emacs Lisp files:

            ;; COPYRIGHT NOTICE
            ;;
            ;; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
            ;; under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free

            ;; for more details. http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

    2.7 Always include installation instructions.

        If file installs itself, it should tell how it behaves after the
        installation (when the commands take in effect, in what modes
        etc.). In addition to installation, include examples how to use the
        package, if it offers some handy functions.

            ;;; Install:

            ;; Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path, add following
            ;; into your $HOME/.emacs startup file.
            ;;
            ;;     (require 'package)
            ;;
            ;; or use autoload and your Emacs starts faster, preferred method:
            ;;
            ;;      (autoload 'package-mode           "package" "" t)
            ;;      (autoload 'turn-on-package-mode   "package" "" t)

    2.8 Always use version control software to manage your files

        Be sure to include some version string in your package:

            (defvar XXX-version (substring "$Revision: 2.11 $" 11 15)
             "Version number")

    2.9 Always check your file with byte compiler

        Don't leave leaks in your code. Use Byte compiler to catch any
        variable leaks or missing functions that you should load with
        (require 'xxx) in the beginning of your file. If possible prefer
        _XEmacs_ _Byte_ _Compiler_, which reports error much better. In
        compatibility point of view it is good to check with both XEmacs
        and Emacs byte compiler.

            emacs -q -no-site-file          ;; In clean emacs
            M-x byte-compile-file XXX.el

    2.10 More details -- don't just 'require' other packages

        When you include packages with `require' command, don't
        do it like this:

            (require 'dired-aux)

        If it only uses 2-5 functions from package. (you can tell what
        functions it uses by running the Byte Compiler on your file while
        you had commented all `require' lines away). The following will
        reduce memory if package *dired-aux* supports dynamic byte
        compilation. In addition, your package compiles faster, because the
        other packages need not to be required beforehand.

            (eval-and-compile
              (autoload 'dired-bunch-files          "dired-aux")
              (autoload 'dired-run-shell-command    "dired-aux"))

    2.11 Use dynamic byte compilation

        Newer Emacs versions can load only the functions to memory that are
        really and not just slurp the whole file. Put this in your
        packages, near the first require command in your package.

            (eval-when-compile (setq byte-compile-dynamic t))

        There is also alternative way to set up byte compilation, but it
        requires crowding your first line, which you prefer to use for
        package description. This is _not_  _recommended_. See INFO page
        "File: elisp, Node: Dynamic Loading".

            -*-byte-compile-dynamic: t;-*-

    2.12 How to deal with variables from other packages

        Let's say you use `ediff-number-of-differences' variable in function
        `xxx-my-ediff-call'. This is the only place where ediff is used and
        for that reason you haven't used

            (require 'ediff)

        but used the more lighter version

            (eval-and-compile
              (autoload 'ediff-get-difference "ediff"))

        But the byte compiler tells you that `ediff-number-of-differences'
        is unknown variable. Ok, let's tell byte compiler about it with:

            (eval-and-compile
              (defvar ediff-get-difference)
              (autoload 'ediff-get-difference "ediff"))

        Note that `defvar' only contains variable name and _no_ _value_. It
        really doesn't define the variable, but makes byte compiler to take
        a note. If you do this test, you see that the variable is not
        bound.

            (progn
              (defvar 'xxx)
              (boundp 'xxx))
            --> nil

        It depends if you can do this kind of optimizations or not. If
        the value *must* *be* present, do not use this autoload
        optimization, but use the traditional `require'. If you only
        *check* the variable in our code like below, then the autoload is
        okay:

            (when (boundp 'ediff-get-difference)
              ..ok, we're set to do the things...)

    2.13 Arrange the installation so that it can be autoloaded

        Try to avoid this form of loading if you can. Do not say that
        this is the only way to use the package:

            To use this package, put following into your emacs:
            (require 'XXX)

        That's bad, because if user never happens to use any of these
        functions, they still are in Emacs and consume resources. Instead
        try to offer another way to use your package by using autoload.
        This has two effects:

        o   Autoload statements in one's `$HOME/.emacs' are fast!
            Emacs starts up instantly without loading the package.
        o   The package is only loaded when user calls
            some of your functions. Someday he may be using
            them all the time, other times he works differently
            and doesn't use the functions. Don't assume that
            the package is always *on*.

        If the package installs key bindings, then you should show where to
        hook the package to get things going. See For example
        *tinydired.el*, which uses sophisticated booting. When dired
        loads, "package" installs everything at the same time
        and only these lines are needed in for user setup:

            (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook '(lambda () (require 'package) nil))

        Other times, you can just instruct for interactive functions

                (autoload 'XXX-func1            "XXX" "" t)
                (autoload 'XXX-func2            "XXX" "" t)

        If your functions are accessed by keyboard command, then you have
        to mention couple of keybindings:

                (autoload 'XXX-func1            "XXX" "" t)
                (autoload 'XXX-func2            "XXX" "" t)
                (global-set-key [(control f1)]  'XXX-func1)

        Now pressing the key `C-f1' autolaods function. Do not ask to put
        all key definitions to his $`$HOME/.emacs'. Add those keys that you
        think user may hit most likely to utilize your package for the
        first calls.

    2.14 Do not change any emacs bindings directly

        Put bindings behind a function, and allow user to customize them.
        Like this:

            (defun XXX-install-default-bindings ()
             "docs here..."
             (global-set-key "X" 'XXX-func1)
             (global-set-key "Y" 'XXX-func2)
             (global-set-key "Z" 'XXX-func3)
             ...)

        Next, you can instruct in installation, that user can add following
        statement if he wants to use the default bindings.

            (add-hook 'XXX-load-hook 'XXX-install-default-bindings)

        When file is loaded the bindings take in effect. You could also put
        it this way:

            (defvar XXX-load-hook '(XXX-default-bindings)
              "*Hook run when package is loaded.")

        and then say, that "if you DO NOT WANT the default bindings, put
        statement into your .emacs".

            (setq XXX-load-hook nil)

        The first method is better if you really change direct Emacs
        bindings. And the latter, if you just _add_ some bindings
        somewhere which is free slot.

    2.15 Don't forget to add ###autoload statements

        Someday, perhaps your package may be included into emacs
        distribution, or some system administrator may want to include your
        package to `site-init.el'.

            ;;;###autoload
            (defun XX () ..)

        Where should you put the statements? Thumb rule: all interactive
        functions should have it. See emacs info pages for more.

            File: elisp, Node: Autoload

    2.16 Document all your variables and functions well

        They should be as clear as crystal, so that they contain
        descriptive *documentation* string. Use "*" for user variables
        (File: elisp, Node: Defining Variables). The more documentation the
        better, because user wants to do

            C-h v VARIABLE
            C-h f FUNCTION

        and see all we wants to know, without looking at the source file
        itself. Don't mind the documentation string space, new 19.29+ Emacs
        Byte Compiler is capable of reducing the documentation string
        memory consumption. Refer to (NEWS file of 19.29, section 'changes
        in compilation:')

          ...Functions and variables loaded from a
          byte-compiled file now refer to the file for their doc
          strings.

        Don't write like this as it was used to be old convention to leave
        out internal function description:

            (defun XXX-internal-function ()
              ;; Don't hide docs below a function.
              ;; This emans that everyone must open the source file in
              ;; order to find out how the function is documented.
              ...)

        That's bad, because then you can't just sit on Emacs buffer and
        hit M-x appropos RET XXX-internal-function RET. I'd like to
        see the function documentation shown, don't you?

    2.18 Provide a xxx-load-hook at the end of file

        If you think that user may want to change some default settings add
        the last hook. The load hook runs *after* provide. Like this.
        Include ending line as a last line

            (provide   'XXX)
            (run-hooks 'XXX-load-hook)
                                     << at least one space here!
            ;; XXX.el ends here
                                     << max 1 line here only.

        There is also `eval-after-load' that is supported by new emacs
        releases. If you wan't to be portable, then you should know that
        XEmacs 19.14 doesn't even have such hook, not to mention old emacs
        releases. In addition, managing the structures put via
        ``eval-after-load' to `after-load-alist' is not s nice as
        manipulating the items with `add-hook' and `remove-hook'.

    2.17 Clean up all whitespaces from the end of lines

        This is important, because if someone sends you patches, the diff
        command would count the whitespace differences too. Well, there
        is options to bypass that, but removing extra whitespace is good
        idea anyway.

            (add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'my-trim-blanks)

            (defun my-trim-blanks (beg end)
              "Delete trailing blanks in region"
              (interactive "*r")
              (save-restriction
                (save-excursion
                  (narrow-to-region beg end)
                  ;;  _much slower would be:
                  ;;  (replace-regexp "[ \t]+$" "")
                  (goto-char (point-min))
                  (while (not (eobp))
                    (end-of-line)
                    (delete-horizontal-space)
                    (forward-line 1))))
              ;;  To be sure, clean hook returns nil
              nil))

    2.18 Documentation of you package

        Just for the curious reader, if you have www page where you can
        describe your emacs packages, you could format your documentation
        so that it can be easily ripped out and turned into HTML page. For
        more about this, see Perl files at
        http://cpan.perl.org/modules/by-authors/id/J/JA/JARIAALTO/ The basic
        layout for lisp is this, tab indents 4 spaces at a time. All text
        between `Preface' and 'Change Log' is considered as documentation
        that can be turned into HTML with

            % ripdoc.pl package.el | t2html.pl > package.html
