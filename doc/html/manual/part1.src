        This page contains manual pages from each Emacs tiny*.el module in
        alphabetical order. The tools initially started around 1994 and
        they include many Emacs related utilities ranging from Emacs path
        configuration, email, Gnus spam reply functions, diffing, patching,
        URL jumping, eating text and many more.

            Note: you cannot download single files or install only a
            single file. the minimum requirement are all libraries
            _tinylib*.el_ plus any individual utility package.

    Generated documentation

        This document is automatically generated from the Emacs lisp files
        with 2 small perl scripts: *ripdoc.pl* is available at
        http://cpan.perl.org/modules/by-authors/id/J/JA/JARIAALTO/
        and the other is hosted at http://perl-text2html.sourceforge.net/

            % ripdoc.pl `ls ti*.el|sort` | t2html.pl > emacs-tiny-tools.html

        The perl program assume that the documentation sections have been
        written in Technical Text Format (you are looking at TF layout in
        this file). An Emacs minor mode for writing TF files is available in
        package *tinytf.el*.

    Brief overview

        There are plenty of packages to choose from and almost nobody uses
        them all in one emacs session, so here are some recommendations.
        The setup examples for many of these packages are available in the
        unpacked kit under *rc/emacs-rc-tiny.el*. Start with the top ten
        and add other packages that you find useful. The order of
        appearance is also the recommended installation order: "install
        this, see the docs, and go to next one..."

        Top ten or so

        o   _TinyPath_ -- Find your your whole load path hierarchy.
            No more manual updating of `load-path' or other Emacs system
            variables. Transparent compressed lisp file support.
        o   _Tinyeat_ -- More easier text deletion. eg. C-backspace and
            Alt-backspace do all your text delete operations.
        o   _TinyTab_ -- Set your tab to 2 4 8 and keep text and code
            nicely formatted in any mode, like in `mail-mode',
            `message-mode', `cc-mode', `lisp-mode', `perl-mode' ...
        o   _TinyUrl_ -- Jump to http url at point (C++, Perl, lisp support
            too) This minor mode can be permanently on and it marks links
            all links under current line. Press M-RET or mouse-2 to jump
            to link. Centralized url handling, no need to configure VM, Gnus or
            browse-url separately.
        o   _TinyMail_ -- TAB completes your defined aliases, BBDB entries
            and /etc/password file. *REPORTS* *INCOMING* *MAIL* in X frame or
            echo area.
        o   _TinyMy_ -- Grabbag of utilities. Automatic window change when
            pointing it with mouse. Make dos files readable with C-c m D
            display minor mode etc. Automatic save of your most important
            files.
        o   _TinyHotlist_ -- Keep hotlist of most important buffers in X-popup
            and jump to buffer in the list. The selection can be existing
            buffer, pointer to file (ange-ftp file) or directory. This
            is the "Most important work files: permanent list"
        o   _TinySearch_ -- more faster "search word" than cumbersome C-s C-w..
            At current point hit F2/S-F2 to search the word forward/backward.
        o   _TinyReplace_ -- More convenient replace than M-%. Can replace
            over multiple files (run M-x grep to and hit % in compile buffer)
            RCS file support (checkout before replace)
        o   _TinyEf_ -- C-x C-f file path manipulation in minibuffer.
            Electric file composing minor mode: $ / ~ keys are special.
        o   _TinyCb_ -- Change Buffers in one window. useful only if you have
            small amount of buffers in Emacs session. Use `C-.' and `C-,' to
            circulate buffer list in window.
        o   _TinyLoad_ -- Delayed loading of lisp packages.

        Other packages

        o   _TinyTf_ -- Write text documents easily and convert them to html.
            Eg. this document uses TF format (Technical Format)
