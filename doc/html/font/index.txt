        This document is compiled from Usenet postings that concern Emacs's
        coloring support, often referred as fontification. The document is
        constantly kept up to date whenever interesting articles appear in
        the user group gnu.emacs.help. (2002-08-08: This document may
        contains very old information))

    1.1 Lazy Lock mode

        Highlighting is done (1) on a demand-driven basis, and (2) when
        Emacs is idle. Demand-driven means that fontification occurs in
        only the visible part of the buffer (the window), and only when and
        where necessary. Lazy Lock can also fontify the invisible parts of
        the buffer after a certain amount of time of idleness (when there
        is no input).

    1.2 Font-lock, lazy-lock, defer-lock, fast-lock -- say what ?

          How do font-lock with lazy-lock, defer-lock and fast-lock work
          together and which combination is the best respectively ?

        Simon Marshall <Simon.Marshall@esrin.esa.it>

        The difference is that fast-lock.el caches fontification in files.
        Thus visiting a file is very quick. It does not affect anything
        else. However, lazy-lock.el version 2 (for Emacs 19.30 and up) does
        various different things. It delays fontification both when you
        visit a file and (optionally) when you type. The result is that
        things like scrolling are a little slower, but typing is faster,
        with lazy-lock.el (compared to font-lock.el or font-lock.el with
        fast-lock.el).

        So, if having lots of cache files bothers you, use lazy-lock.el.
        If you find that font-lock.el is too slow when typing, use
        lazy-lock.el. If you find that lazy-lock.el is too slow when
        scrolling, use fast-lock.el. Try them out; the choice is yours. I
        think lazy-lock.el is probably used more than fast-lock.el.

2.0 Lazy fontification for fast Font Lock mode

    2.1 Announcement of lazy-lock.el v2.04

        Hi folks, <Simon.Marshall@esrin.esa.it>

        Here is version 2.04 of lazy-lock.el. This version works with Emacs
        19.30 and later. (Currently XEmacs does not have the features to
        support lazy-lock.el.) See also fast-lock.el, now distributed with
        both Emacs and XEmacs, but use one or the other!

        Lazy Lock mode speeds up Font Lock mode in a number of ways:

        o   Buffer fontification can be demand-driven. This means that
            initial fontification of the buffer does not occur if the
            buffer is larger than a certain size (default 25K
            bytes). Instead, fontification occurs when necessary, such as
            when scrolling through the buffer would otherwise reveal
            unfontified areas. This is useful if buffer fontification is
            too slow for large buffers.
        o   On-the-fly fontification can be deferred. This means that
            on-the-fly fontification does not occur as you type. Instead,
            fontification is deferred until Emacs has been idle for a
            certain amount of time (default 0.25 seconds). This is useful
            if on-the-fly fontification is too slow to keep up with your
            typing.
        o   Buffer fontification can be stealthy. This means that remaining
            unfontified areas of buffers are fontified if Emacs has been
            idle for a certain amount of time (default 30 seconds). This is
            useful if any buffer has demand-driven fontification.

        Changes since the previous version:

        o   Deferral can be specified on a mode-by-mode basis. This means
            that you can specify that deferral is used in only modes where
            you find on-the-fly fontification is too slow to keep up with
            your typing.
        o   Emacs 19.31 idle timers are used to implement deferral and
            stealth. This means that problems or oddities experienced when
            using Transient Mark mode and Shell mode (and other modes based
            on Comint mode) have gone away.
        o   Fixed bug whereby changing the window buffer before deferral
            occurred would result in the newly visible buffer being
            unconditionally fontified.
        o   Fixed bug whereby scrolling after inserting a large amount of
            text into a small buffer would result in the new text being
            seen unfontified.
        o   Fixed feature whereby stealth fontification would not be
            interruptible when searching for, but failing to find, a buffer
            that required fontification.

        Version 2 of lazy-lock.el is a drop-in replacement for lazy-lock.el
        version 1 and defer-lock.el, only it is much better than both of
        them put together. Actually, if you use *either* of these packages
        with Emacs 19.30 and later you should change to version 2 of
        lazy-lock.el.

        Note that this version will not be placed on the Emacs Lisp
        Archive, because I want to leave version 1 there for pre-Emacs
        19.30 users. Eventually, version 2 of lazy-lock.el will be
        distributed with some future version of Emacs.

        See the comment header for more information and installation
        instructions, and the comment header and command 'lazy-lock-mode'
        for usage instructions.

        Please report problems, etc., via M-x lazy-lock-submit-bug-report
        RET. Enjoy, Simon.

    2.2 Font-lock-extra.el

        .Ilya Zakharevich (ilya@math.ohio-state.edu)
        .ftp://ftp.math.ohio-state.edu/pub/users/ilya/emacs

        It is designed for mostly package writers. It is documented that the
        only benefits you get without tuning your .emacs are in CPerl-mode.
        You can also use -3 and -4 keywords for C and C++ (for -4 you would
        better get ctypedefs too. And if you want to tune-up faces,
        you will appreciate this package.

3.0 Font-lock and lazy-lock: questions and answers

    3.1 Fast fontification

        If you want fast fontification don't use the function
        'font-lock-mode' your small redraw function can simply be
        `font-lock-fontify-buffer' (but if you bind it to [return] then you
        should use lazy-lock too)

    3.2 Font-lock is pain slow with big files.. -- use lazy-lock

        The lazy-lock.el it's a "must" for font-lock

        .(setq font-lock-verbose nil)         ; to avoid the annoying messages
        .(setq lazy-lock-continuity-time 0.3) ; refontify after 0.3 inactivity

    3.3 Font-lock in non windowed Emacs

          I have added customizations to emacs to start on the Font Lock
          mode and also colors for the hook "window-setup-hook". It works fine
          when I start emacs in the usual way (emacs). However when I start in
          the No Window mode by using "emacs -nw" I get the following error:
          "Symbol's function definition is void: set-face-foreground"

        <bouzas@physics.ucla.edu> (Antonio Bouzas)

        I have the following code in my .emacs, to avoid that problem,

            (cond
             (window-system
              (set-default-font
               "-ncd-terminal-medium-r-normal-*-23-180-*-*-*-*-*-*")
              ))

    3.4 Ascii terminal highlighting

          Please, does anyone have any ideas about how or if I can persuade
          emacs to fontify?

       <hchau@landau.ucdavis.edu>

        Not that I know of. I heard that XEmacs does some basic
        fontification. But if you really want syntax coloring over
        the serial line, use Jed. It available at

            ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/jed/

        It is an emacs clone so you would have no problem if you know
        emacs. Then if you want a newsreader that also does coloring pick
        up slrn too. This is what I use when I am over the serial
        line. Emacs and vim at work and Jed and vim at home.

      Steven L. Baur <Asteve@diana.miranova.com>

        Font-lock-mode in XEmacs 19.14 is supposed to have full colour ANSI
        terminal support. 19.13 has terminal font-lock in only black &
        white at present.If you're running on limited memory for Linux,
        your best bet is XEmacs with the relocating allocation option
        turned on, it grows a lot slower then GNU Emacs does.

        19.13 can't do colors, but it can do the attributes highlight
        (bold), dim, and underline (if your tty can)


        .Vladimir Alexiev <vladimir@cs.ualberta.ca>
        .ftp://ftp.iesd.auc.dk/pub/emacs-lisp/
        .emacs-19.25.90-termcap_faces.tar.gz

        This includes patches for 11 of the emacs source (.c) files, so
        perhaps you'll need root privileges to use it.

        Font-lock-mode in XEmacs 19.14 (still beta as of 25 Apr 1995) has
        full color ANSI terminal support. 19.13 has terminal font-lock in
        only black & white (highlight, dim and underline).

        XEmacs can emit the following TTY attributes: blinking dim
        highlight reverse underline. You set these with
        set-face-***-p. Also, make-face-bold and make-face-italic map to
        highlight and underline respectively.

        You'll also need to see what colours/attributes your terminal
        emulator can display, and choose how to map the above to them. I
        have a mono CGA that basically can display three "colours": normal,
        bold and dim; and can also do reverse and blink. Otherwise you can
        map attributes to colours (e.g., underline to blue, etc). However,
        depending on your mapping, not all attributes will combine nicely,
        because XEmacs does not emit first the colour attributes and then
        the others. E.g., if your normal colour is black-on-white, underline
        is mapped to blue, and xemacs emits reverse before underline, an
        underline-reverse text will come out blue-on-black which is not
        what you want. Of course, dim and highlight are mutually exclusive
        by definition.

        You do the mapping by tweaking termcap. The ANSI tty command "set
        attributes" is of the form \E[*m where * is a string of attribute
        numbers n1;..;nk. num tc face


            --- -- ------------------------------
            0  me default (does NOT reset colour.
               In kermit say "SET TERMINAL COLOUR 20" to have it reset it.)
            1  md highlight=bold
            2  mh dim
            3  so reverse ("standout")
            4  us underline=italic
            5  mb blinking
            7  mr --not used--
            2* turn * off (I know the tc for only 23=se and 24=ue)
            3* set foreground (1=red + 2=green + 4=blue)
            4* set background (1=red + 2=green + 4=blue)

        E.g., I use this for my mono CGA:

            mh=\E[1;30m:so=\E[7m:se=\E[m:us=\E[1;30m:ue=\E[m

        mh=dim and us=underline are gray-on-black, `so' is mapped to
        \E[7m because kermit does not understand \E[3m. Find the
        termcap for your tty and append that line. In "screen", use
        the command

            termcap vt100 LP:mh=\E[1;30m:so=\E[7m:se=\E[m:us=\E[1;30m:ue=\E[m

        A patch is available from <vladimir@cs.ualberta.ca> that makes
        edit-faces.el more useful for ttys.

      Alex Ott <ottalex@narod.ru>

        GNU Emacs since version 21 provides support for font-lock on
        text terminals with color support (like xterm or linux console
        terminal).  For comfortable job with font-lock, user may
        define two set of font-lock colors attribute configurations
        for window system use and terminal use.

    3.5 Lazy lock doesn't work for small buffers ?

        (setq lazy-lock-minimum-size nil) for small buffers Otherwise it's
        never refontified in small buffers

    3.6 Postscript printing

          I've been using font-lock modes for editing C, C++, and Tcl
          sources and I like it so much that I would like to produce
          PostScript listings of those programs with the same nice
          font-locked format. Has anyone done this before? A:
          jcolman@lehman.com (Jake Colman)

        Try `ps-print.el' available from the ohio-state archives in the
        packages subdirectory. It purports to print a file the same way it
        looks with font-lock.

    3.7 Internal-facep error

          When I bring up a file (say .emacs) up in emacs, I get an error
          message: "Error in init file:Wrong type argument:internal-facep,
          font-lock-comment-face"

          My font settings are:

            (setq font-lock-use-fonts t)
            (setq font-lock-use-colours nil)
            (setq font-lock-use-maximal-decoration t)
            ;; After font-lock is loaded, you can set the colours and still use
            ;; italic & bold fonts as chosen.
            (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-comment-face       "Violet")
            (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-keyword-face       "White")

        <Simon.Marshall@esrin.esa.it>

        The first two are specific to XEmacs; you don't need them in Emacs
        as it works out whether your display is colour or not. The last two
        are failing because at that time your ~/.emacs is loaded, the faces
        have not been created. The way to change the attributes are as
        follows:

        . Modify the variable font-lock-face-attributes in your ~/.emacs.
        . Use X resources (see the doc-string of font-lock-face-attributes).
        . Call font-lock-make-faces in your .emacs and then do the
            above code.

        Don't use (3); in fact you don't need to preload font-lock at all.
        Remove your require from your ~/.emacs and just do things like:

            (add-hook 'foo-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)
            (setq font-lock-face-attributes '((font-lock-comment-face ..) ..))

        though it's probably cleaner to do (2) than to do (1).

    3.8 GNUS article highlighting

          Nowhere in the font-lock-keywords list for gnus-article-mode it says
          to highlight strings but they highlit anyway. How do I turn this
          off?

        <Simon.Marshall@esrin.esa.it> Make sure that the value of
        `font-lock-no-comments' is t in the buffer.

    3.9 I'd like to be able to change the colours for the comments

        Alf-Ivar Holm <alfh@gyda.ifi.uio.no>

            (setq font-lock-face-attributes
             '((font-lock-comment-face "DarkGoldenrod" nil nil t)
             (font-lock-string-face "red")))

        Look at the documentation of font-lock-face-attributes (C-h v) for
        more info.

    3.10 Font-lock colours - how to change defaults?

        Kai Grossjohann <grossjoh@ls6.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>

        With Emacs 19.30 and up you can set font-lock-face-attributes which is
        rather simple to understand, I think.

            (setq font-lock-face-attributes
                '(
                  ;; FACE              FORE    BACK BOLD? IT? UNDERLINE?
                  (font-lock-type-face "green" nil  nil   t   nil)
                  ;; ...more lines like this...))

    3.11 Customizing faces

          I'm unable to correctly customize font-lock to display certain faces
          in bold and/or italic.

        Ulrik Dickow <dickow@nbi.dk> Don't use a hook. Just do for example
        something like this in your .emacs:

            (copy-face 'italic  'font-lock-comment-face)
            (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-comment-face "FireBrick")
            (setq font-lock-comment-face 'font-lock-comment-face)

        This works whether font-lock.el has been loaded already or not.
        It doesn't even require that `window-system' is non-nil.
        See also http://www.nbi.dk/~dickow/emacs/ for working examples.

    3.12 Different face setup

          How do I set up different colours for the different faces in my
          .emacs file. For instance I want to change the colour of
          font-lock-comment-face at start up.

        Kai Grossjohann <grossjoh@ls6.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>

            ;; create a new face
            (make-face 'sg-comment-face)
            ;; set its foreground and background colour
            (set-face-foreground 'sg-comment-face "blue")
            (set-face-background 'sg-comment-face "green")
            ;; let the new face be the font-lock-comment-face
            (setq font-lock-comment-face 'sg-comment-face)

        If there is an existing face you like (try =M-x=
        =list-faces-display= for a list), you can just use the setq
        line with that face instead of sg-comment-face.

    3.13 Highlight specific words

          In a specific mode I want to highlight some specified words,
          but not strings. I do I accomplish this?

      Alf-Ivar Holm <alfh@gyda.ifi.uio.no>

      [latest font-lock only] There is a variable called
      font-lock-keywords-only (C-h v) that you can set directly, or
      indirectly with font-lock-defaults like:

            (add-hook
             'modename-mode-hook
             '(lambda ()
                (make-local-variable 'font-lock-defaults)
                 (setq font-lock-defaults
                       '(modename-font-lock-keywords t nil))))

    4.2 Font-mode colours - how to change defaults?

        Mosur K. Mohan <mmohan@dtthp144.intel.com>

        Here's a snippet of my startup file which resets my colours (works for

    4.3 Font-lock for different modes ?

          Is it possible to have different fonts in different modes? for
          example, I'd like to use one font as default, and another when i call
          cc-mode.

        Joe Jackson <jackson@shoeless.lanl.gov>

        Try a construct like the following;

            (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook 'my-font-lock-for-lisp)

            (defun my-font-lock-common ()
              "Common settings for all modes."
              (setq-default
               font-lock-auto-fontify            t
               font-lock-use-fonts               nil
               font-lock-use-maximal-decoration  t
               font-lock-use-colours              t
               font-lock-mode-enable-list        nil
               font-lock-mode-disable-list       nil)
              (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-comment-face       "red")
              (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-string-face        "blue")
              (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-function-name-face "darkgreen")
              (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-keyword-face       "magenta")
              (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-type-face          "Coral")
              (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-reference-face     "Black")
              (set-face-background 'font-lock-reference-face     "LightBlue"))

            (defun my-font-lock-for-lisp ()
              "My font settings."
              (my-font-lock-common)
              (font-lock-mode 0)
              (set-face-font        'italic      "8x13")
              (set-face-foreground  'italic      "black")
              (set-face-background  'italic      "lightgrey")
              (set-face-font        'bold-italic "8x13bold")
              (set-face-foreground  'bold-italic "black")
              (set-face-font        'bold        "8x13")
              (set-face-foreground  'bold        "blue")
              (set-face-foreground  'underline   "maroon")
              (set-face-underline-p 'underline   nil)
              (set-face-background  'region      "powder blue"))

        Every mode has a mode-hook so you can set the fonts for each mode
        separately and achieve the look you desire. This is also a good way
        to customize other emacs behaviors such as auto-fill-mode and
        fill-column.

    4.4 Font-lock won't fontify multi-line c-style comments?

        Paul D. Smith <psmith@baynetworks.com> answers:

        You don't specify what version of Emacs you're using, so I'll
        assume Emacs 19.30. Look at the elisp file defining the major
        mode. See if it installs its own syntax table; it should. It'll
        probably be called sql-mode-syntax-table, for a mode called
        sql-mode.

        So, you'll see a syntax table definition, something like this:

            ;; Set up our syntax table
            ;;
            (defvar sql-mode-syntax-table nil
              "Syntax table in use in sql-mode buffers.")

            (if sql-mode-syntax-table
                ()
              (setq sql-mode-syntax-table (make-syntax-table))
              (modify-syntax-entry ?\\  "\\"   sql-mode-syntax-table)
                ...)

        You want to add the following lines to the list of modifications to the
        syntax table:

            (modify-syntax-entry ?/ ". 14" sql-mode-syntax-table)
            (modify-syntax-entry ?* ". 23" sql-mode-syntax-table)

        Remove any other settings of ?/ or ?* you see there. Make sure the
        darn thing gets installed! Look in the function sql-mode and make
        sure something like this is in there:

            (set-syntax-table sql-mode-syntax-table)

        And make sure font-lock is on. Voila! Fontification of comments
        should work just fine. If you want to do it in a mode hook rather
        than change the source for the mode, add this (assuming the hook is
        sql-mode-hook, of course :)

            (add-hook 'sql-mode-hook
              '(lambda ()
                 (modify-syntax-entry ?/ ". 14")
                 (modify-syntax-entry ?* ". 23")))

    4.6 Enable font-lock-mode for a whole list of modes ?

        Ulrik Dickow <dickow@nbi.dk>

        Please take a look at my home page for more font goodies

            http://www.nbi.dk/~dickow

        I use the following piece of elisp to automatically enable
        font-lock-mode for a whole list of modes, unless the file is larger
        than a given limit:

                 lock mode, when buffer size is less than the variable
                 `font-lock-max-enable' (see that).
                 The list is read during only the loading of nbi-faces.el,
                 so modify `font-lock-max-enable' instead if you want
                 to separate modes afterwards.
                 See also `hilit-mode-enable-list'.")

    4.7 Locking Regions of Text (Answer + Summary)

        <aep@world.std.com> (Andrew E Page):

        In summary, regions of read-only text can be accomplished with
        emacs scripts that use the text properties functions available in
        the language. Basically most of the information necessary can be
        found in "The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual" Sec 29.17(Text
        Properties).

        The text affected is either a buffer or a string that you specify
        in the <object> argument (See below). If no <object> is specified
        then the it works on the current buffer.

        The pertinent command is:

            add-text-properties <start> <end> <props> &optional <object>

        o   <start> Absolute character position of the start of the text
            that you wish to add the property to.
        o   <end> Absolute character position of the end of the text
            that you wish to add the property to.
        o   <props> Property/value pairs that you wish to add to the text.
            Examples:

            '(read-only t)   Makes the text read-only
            '(read-only nil) Reverses the above
            '(face bold)     Makes the text appear emboldened
            '(face italic)   Set the text to italic
            '(face default)  Sets the text back to the default face
            '(intangible t)  Sets the text so that the insert point
                             cannot be set between <start> and <end>

        *Cautionary* *notes:*

        Apparently this does not work for all version of Emacs. In My case
        I'm using 19.27. Setting the text proper 'intangible' makes the
        text invisible to searches. So if you are searching for text with
        'search-forward' or search-backward, text that has been made
        intangible will be ignored by the search.

        When specifying several properties at once to be added to text that
        includes 'read-only t' make sure that 'read-only' is the LAST
        property to be added, otherwise the rest will fail:

            ;; this will FAIL since the text becomes read-only first
            ;;
            '(read-only t face bold)

            ;; this will succeed since the face is set then the t
            ;; ext is made read-only
            ;;
            '(face bold read-only t)

        If you specify a face that is not available for the font that has
        been loaded the command will fail. So if 'bold' or 'italic' text is
        not available for the font that is being used. the command will
        fail. I found this out when the line in my
        X11/lib/app-defaults/Emacs file for font was as follows:

            Emacs*font:6x13

        Setting the text to bold or italic will cause the script to fail
        since neither mode is available for this font. I got better results
        with the following:

            Emacs*font:-adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

        which allowed me to set both bold and italic text. Example: Here's
        some code that sets a C comment to be read-only and intangible:

            ;; 1. goto the the top of the file
            ;; 2. get the start of the comment
            ;; 3. get the end of the comment
            ;;
            (goto-char (point-min))
            (setq ro-text-start (- (search-forward "/*") 2))
            (setq ro-text-end (search-forward "*/")) ;
            (add-text-properties ro-text-start ro-text-end
              '(intangible t read-only t))

        gnu.emacs.help ...A couple of weeks ago I posted an ELISP file that
        added font-lock info for colourizing JAVA code. Do a deja-news
        search for my name under gnu.emacs.help and you should find it. It
        was a .zip file.

    5.4 LaTeX

        Jaap Henk Hoepman <jhh@cwi.nl>

        As I'm not sure whether the default installation of Emacs gives any
        useful font-locking for TeX or LaTeX files, I'll tell how I
        installed it for Emacs 19.27. You will have to put the following
        lines into your .emacs file:

            ;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~ This is in your .emacs ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            (font-lock-mode 0) ;; force loading of the font-lock package

            ;; specify the colours and underlining of the different standard
            ;; type-faces (In used colours because I really like the 9x15
            ;; fixed font which doesn't have sensible bold or italics)

            (set-face-foreground  'bold             "firebrick3")
            (set-face-foreground  'italic           "turquoise4")
            (set-face-foreground  'bold-italic      "blue")
            (set-face-underline-p 'underline        nil)
            (set-face-foreground  'underline        "blueviolet")

            ;; bind the standard type-faces to the font-lock faces, some
            ;; already have a sensible default

            (setq font-lock-type-face 'bold)


            ;; the following list specifies that strings matching one of the
            ;; regular expressions should be rendered using the
            ;; font-lock-...-face that follows it

            (setq
             tex-font-lock-keywords
             '(
               ("\\(\\\\\\(begin\\|end\\){[a-zA-Z0-9\\*]+}\\)"
                1 font-lock-function-name-face nil)

               ("\\(\\\\\\(.\\|[a-zA-Z@]+\\)\\)"
                1 font-lock-keyword-face nil)

               ("\\\\def[\\\\@]\\([a-zA-Z@]+\\)"
                1 font-lock-function-name-face t)

               ("\\([^\\\\]\\|^\\)\\$\\([^$]*\\)\\$"
                2 font-lock-string-face t)

               ("\\\\\\[\\(\\([^]]\\|^\\)*\\)\\\\\\]"
                1 font-lock-string-face t)))

    5.6 Procmail

        Andrew Cosgriff <ajc@unico.com.au>

        here's all you need to do to highlight your .procmailrc - (i put
        a -*- procmail -*- at the top of my .procmailrc to activate this
        "mode". If anybody has a real indenting mode for procmailrc's,
        i'd love to see it.). Works for me under XEmacs 19.14.

            (defun procmail-mode ()
              "Mode for highlighting procmailrc files"
              (interactive)
              (setq mode-name "Procmail"
                    major-mode 'procmail))

            (setq procmail-font-lock-keywords
                  (list '("#.*"
                          . font-lock-comment-face)
                        '("^[\t ]*:.*"
                          . font-lock-type-face)
                        '("[A-Za-z_]+=.*"
                          . font-lock-keyword-face)
                        '("^[\t ]*\\*.*"
                          . font-lock-doc-string-face)
                        '("\$[A-Za-z0-9_]+"
                          . font-lock-function-name-face)))

        note that you just have to setq MODE-font-lock-keywords, and
        font-lock will automatically trigger for that mode.

    5.7 Rmail headers

          I am using emacs 19.33.1 and font-lock/lazy-lock which came
          along. The typical problem for me is: if I want to highlight headers
          in an RMAIL-buffer (like "^From:", "^Date:", ...) and I want to
          highlight those headers ONLY from the beginning of the buffer and
          before "^--text follows this line--", I don't know how to do it.

        Simon Marshall <Simon.Marshall@esrin.esa.it>

        What you want to do is write a special rmail-fontify-region
        function that uses two different regexps vars, something like:

            (defvar rmail-font-lock-header-keywords
              '(("^\\(From\\|Sender\\):"
                    . font-lock-function-name-face)
                ("^Reply-To:.*$"
                    . font-lock-function-name-face)
                ("^Subject:"
                    . font-lock-comment-face)
                ("^\\(To\\|Apparently-To\\|Cc\\):"
                    . font-lock-keyword-face)))

            (defvar rmail-font-lock-message-keywords
              '(("^[        ]*\\([A-Za-z]+[A-Za-z0-9_.@-]*\\)?[>|}].*"
               . font-lock-reference-face)))

        or somesuch. But it only uses the former for the region containing
        the header, and the latter for the region containing the message.
        You would then make the value of font-lock-fontify-region-function
        be the symbol rmail-fontify-region in Rmail mode. You would do
        something similar for =mail-mode=.

            (defun my-c++-settings ()
              "C++ for my style."
              (require 'font-lock)

              ;;  Also see c-font-lock-keywords-1 or c++-font-lock-keywords
              (setq c-font-lock-keywords    c-font-lock-keywords-2)
              (setq lisp-font-lock-keywords lisp-font-lock-keywords-2)

    5.9 C++ and new data types

          I would like to add some new datatypes (toto, tutu for instance)
          in c-mode to have them highlighted in the same way that the
          classical ones (float, double, ...). What should I do?

    5.10 Objective-c

        Stephen Peters <speters%samsun@us.oracle.com>

        At the end of this message is a hack I threw together for simple
        Objective-C font-locking, although I'll confess I haven't cleaned
        it up nor looked at it in far too long a time. It's mostly based on
        an old copy of C-mode's highlighting, but it should probably be
        changed to augment the c-font-lock-keywords instead of rewriting
        everything, and I should be using the newer format for
        font-lock-defaults-alist. One of these days I'll have to do that.

    5.12 Sqlmode

        David Worenklein <dcw@gcm.com> There's an sql package that does
        just about anything you could want, including font-locking. It's
        maintained by <sql-mode-help@atlantic2.sbi.com>. Peter Breton
        <pbreton@pbreton.highway1.com> also suggests looking at following

6.0 Emacs HTML writing tools and font lock

    6.1 Html-helper-mode

          ...In article <ytg2h70x8l.fsf@Marvin.fkphy.uni-duesseldorf.de>

            (eval-after-load "html-helper-mode" '(load "html-font"))

          to your .emacs. Works fine for me with 19.28 but produces an
          error File mode specification error: (void-variable
          font-lock-doc-string-face) with 19.29. This is not really a
          problem, highlighting still works.

        This has been fixed. If you want to stay with the old 1994 non-beta
        html-helper-mode.el (without menus), you should get the latest
        version of `html-font.el' (4.01 19-Sep-1995) from

            http://www.nbi.dk/TOOLS/emacs/lisp/html-font.el

        Otherwise upgrade to the latest beta of html-helper-mode.el (2.16
        21-Sep-1995)

            http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/hhm-beta/html-helper-mode.el

        which has all of html-font built-in (and a bit more). You can then
        delete html-font.el. I recommend this latter solution.

          ..I am running 19.27 and it does not work. It flashed an error
          message but it was to fast for me to read. Still no colours.

        First upgrade your html-font _or_ html-helper-mode as explained
        above. For Emacsen older than 19.29 you need a bit more to get
        colours with font-lock in general. The easiest way to obtain that is
        to get Simon Marshall's face-lock.el from the Emacs Lisp Archive,
        e.g.,

 ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/face-lock.el.Z

        and then add something like this to your ~/.emacs:

            (cond
             (window-system
              ;;  don't do this for 19.29+
              ;;
              (if (string-lessp emacs-version "19.28.90")
                  (require 'face-lock)) ; or e.g., `(load "face-lock" t)'
                (add-hook 'html-helper-mode-hook
                           (lambda () (font-lock-mode 1)))))

        and finally I recommend (for Emacs <19.29) adding a line like this
        to your X resources (perhaps ~/.Xdefaults or ~/.Xresources):

            Emacs.font-lock-doc-string-face.attributeForeground:    DarkOrange3

        since face-lock.el unfortunately by default gives this face the
        same colour as `font-lock-string-face'.

    6.2 Html-mode

          ...Anybody know of a html-mode.el that would work with hilite.
          There is a html-mode but it doesn't work with hilite and that
          is actually the > only thing that I would need, that way you
          could read the text a lot > easier than what is the case now.

        I have been using the from

            ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/editors/emacs

        in the archive /hm--html-menus-4.0.tar.gz Its not too recent but it
        hasn't had any problems with maintaining any of the HTML documents
        I've written. It will re-configure the menu with HTML and that drop
        down menu can be used to set the font (colour) for highlighting HTML
        specific text. I wouldn't advise overwriting previous versions of
        *.el as the documentation advises but the there was one change I
        had to make for face-lock to work properly. Sorry, I just can't
        remember what I had to do. The error message pointed to the
        location though so it shouldn't be to hard to find it. (version
        19.30)

7.0 Font lock and hilit19

    7.1 Hilit19 description (old)

          ...I've tried font-lock, because I heard it highlights as you
          type. This is very nice, but it supports relatively few modes
          out of the box, and is relatively hard, or rather, time
          consuming to extend to new modes.

        Henrique Martins <martins@hpl.hp.com>

        Deja vu! I went through the same steps, and gave up for the same
        reason, i.e., not all modes out of the box, and also different
        colours from what I got used to in hilit19. I'm still hoping for
        someone to post a conversion kit from hilit19 to font-lock.

          I've also heard of a hilit319.el or somesuch, but I haven't been
          able to find it. What improvements does it make over hilit19, and
          where can I find it?

        It is called hl319.el, and it should be available as:

            ftp://netcom.com/pub/stig/src/  {Beta,Release}/hl319.el.gz

        Among its new features are user-customizable colours, via the variable
        hilit-user-face-table, e.g.,

            (setq hilit-user-face-table
              '((comment firebrick-italic moccasin  italic)
                (string  grey40           orange    underline)
                (decl    RoyalBlue        cyan      bold)
                (type    nil              yellow    nil)
                (label   cyan-bold        cyan-bold underline)
                (keyword RoyalBlue        cyan      bold-italic)))

        and better on the fly re-highlighting via:

            (add-hook 'find-file-hooks
              '(lambda () (hilit-install-line-hooks)))

    7.2 Don't use hilit19 any more

          I've been recently convinced it would be good to use one of those
          packages, so I'm trying to figure out why there are two packages
          dedicated to hiliting and what are their pros and cons. I've
          seen a few differences (see below), but I'd like to know why you
          like hilit19 or why you prefer font-lock.

        Ulrik Dickow  <dickow@nbi.dk>

        I prefer font-lock. Reasons follow.

            > differences I could see:
            >
            > 1 - font-lock fontifies immediately and is hence slower.
            > 2 - hilit19 fontifies also info/gnus/vm/rmail/etc.. buffers
            > 3 - font-lock is a minor-mode which seems to make sense.
            >     Hilit19's impact is more global and hidden (although you
            >     can tune it easily from variables)
            > 4 - hilit19's way to deal with faces is a bit unusual
            >     (why does it have
            >     to provide its own face-handling functions on top
            >     of emacs19's ?)
            >
            > I don't really care about the second point (hiliting info is not
            > too important to me

        Info is already bold/italic without hilit19/font-lock.

            > and I don't read my mail nor my news from emacs (of course, this
            > might change))

        I do both.

        Rmail-buffers (rmail-mode & rmail-summary-mode) _are_ known to
        font-lock.el. The next version of the news reader ((ding) gnus)
        has extremely fancy highlighting built-in (I'm using an alpha
        version).

            > The first point on another hand seems important at first. But
            > hilit19 has extensions to make it highlight immediately and
            > font-lock can be sped up by removing the after-change-function
            > and replace it by a small redraw function called by ^L or <ret>.

        font-lock can do it easier than that, when you don't want on-the-fly:

        o   don't use the function `font-lock-mode'
        o   your small redraw function can simply be `font-lock-fontify-buffer'
            (but if you bind it to [return] then you should use lazy-lock too)

        However, I don't feel font-lock to be slow in general; on the
        contrary. Here's my summary of "font-lock v.s. hilit19" as I
        happened to post it privately a few weeks ago --- note that I don't
        claim to be strictly objective and that I *do* use lazy-lock by now
        (with tuned defaults):

            > So which is better, font-lock.el or hilit19.el (both in 19.28
            > distribution)?

        It's largely a matter of taste, currently. I'll try to summarize
        the diffs as of 19.28 (h.l.=highlight, N/A=not available), as *I*
        see them:

                                      font-lock         hilit19

            highlight-as-you-type:        Yes (opt)     N/A     1)
            Partial h.l. of big files:    No      2)    Yes
            # of supported modes:         ~10     3)    ~20-25
            Speed:                        ...better     Sometimes *slow*
            Infinite loops seen by me:    No :-)  4)    Yes :-( 5)
            Easily customized:            No      6)    Yes!!   7)
            Being improved on:            Yes           ?

        Notes:

        .   Is in "hl319", a beta release of new hilit19. But I think
            development on hilit has stopped.
        .   Possible with lazy-lock add-on (see LCD). Some users are very
            happy about this and say it's a "must" for font-lock. I don't
            edit big files much --- and/or the computers I use are
            blindingly fast :-). I've made my own simple approach to this:
            no automatic fontification for files bigger than given limit;
            i.e., "nothing or everything". The latter approach will be
            included in 19.29.
        .   User contributions for many more modes exist. E.g., mine for HTML
            and Fortran. In 19.29, more modes will be supported by default,
            I think.
        .   Well, there's something weird when fortran-auto-fill-mode is
            used with my Fortran font-lock. The loop is far from infinite
            though, and I think it's more a problem with
            fortran-auto-fill-mode than with font-lock as such.
        .   In the early days, when I used hilit19, this really annoyed me.
            Seemed to be rooted in hilit19's rather complex way of
            *un*highlighting a buffer before it re-highlights it. Never got
            anything reproducible, though. Seemed like "when switching from
            a GNUS buffer to a Elisp buffer or somesuch..."
        .   font-lock will become easier to customize in 19.29 (will
            incorporate good parts of Simon Marshall's face-lock code, for
            example).
        .   Very good user interface, easy for new users.

    7.3 Font-lock and hilit19 co-operation

          ...It seems, that 'font-lock'+'defer-lock'+'lazy-lock' are better
          then 'hilit19'. could anybody help me, how should i change my
          '.emacs' to use the 'font-lock' method instead of 'hilit19', and
          tell me, what to do besides this ?

        L.G. "Ted" Stern <stern@amath.washington.edu>

        I have found that some packages do better with font-lock and some
        still "prefer" hiliting. I also found that the default setting for
        hilit19 is to "take over" some keys, so I have turned that
        off. Here is what I do to have font-lock in some modes and hilit19
        in others. Note that I have lazy-lock enabled but not defer-lock. I
        hadn't heard about that until I saw your post!


            ;; To make font-lock and hilit19 coexist comfortably, I make
            ;; sure that hilit19 does not rebind keys. To re-highlight the
            ;; buffer you can still do S-C-l (Shift-Control-l). I then
            ;; define a new function (which is basically copied verbatim
            ;; from hilit19.el with some simple substitutions) to fontify
            ;; various types of regions, and locally bind it to S-C-l in
            ;; fontified modes for parallel functionality.

            (defvar font-lock-auto-fontify t
              "* If this is non-nil, then font-lock-fontify-command will

              before and after the cursor, and the symbol 'visible'

    8.3 No fonts matching patters are same size as comment

          Why doesn't the following give error: (set-face-font
          'comment "italic")

        Marc Girod <girod@dshp01.trs.ntc.nokia.com>

        It is a restriction of emacs that all fonts used in a frame must be
        the same size. In addition, they must be fixed spaced. Your
        make-face created a face named comment, and assigned to it you
        default font. I assume that "italic" is an alias in your system for
        a font of a size different from this of your default font.

        You have to select a default font for which exist on your system
        variants for bold, italic, and optionally bold-italic in the same
        size, and in fixed spaced fonts.

        Then your code will work. I suggest however that you specify all
        your fonts through X resources. I guess that the solution Kai
        suggests in an other posting will work, if there is on your system
        an italic fixed font the same size as your default. Even so, I
        don't know whether emacs necessarily knows what to modify to get
        it. On my system, it could be hard for it... without help. My
        default and italic fonts are respectively (there are aliases to
        make it shorter):

  -b&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-sans-12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1
  -adobe-courier-medium-o-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1

        The point is that no trivial change in the pattern would switch the
        one from the other:

            "*-i-*"

        ...or something like that, even correct (I didn't check that this
        could work). In this italic font, the italic property is encoded in
        the 'o' (for oblique I guess). In other fonts, it is with an 'i',
        as in:

            -adobe-times-medium-i-normal-*-17-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

        (unfortunately proportional!) Ok. Now, my settings (working for me,
        if anything)

        and to use these from font-lock, this's what I use, although there
        may be more elegant ways:

            (setq font-lock-string-face 'font-lock-string-face)
            (make-face font-lock-string-face)

            (setq font-lock-comment-face 'font-lock-comment-face)
            (make-face font-lock-comment-face)

            (setq font-lock-type-face 'font-lock-type-face)
            (make-face font-lock-type-face)

            (setq font-lock-keyword-face 'font-lock-keyword-face)
            (make-face font-lock-keyword-face)

9.0 Why all the fonts are not available in emacs ?

          Where is all the font I have many fonts which are accessible
          (/usr/lib/X11/fonts/*) which don't pop up in the pop-up menu
          (C-mouse 3 on my platform).I was unable to find info in the FAQ's
          and online info. Can anyone tell me a font-path to change, or
          another fix?

        .Date:    Mon, 31 Oct 1994

        (Updated version: smaller code and more instructions how to use it)

        Hey!

        Writing ISO Latin 2 support for Emacs (now gone to testing, will be
        out in two weeks or so) I found myself in the dire need for
        checking the existence of Latin 2 fonts on the server... and then
        for adding these fonts to x-fixed-font-alist (mouse font menu, that
        is).

        Also, being fed up with enhancing manually x-fixed-font-alist of
        every single emacs version released, I decided to write a general
        function to do this for me. Here is the result, after 3 days of
        work.

        Upon loading this code just queries the server; to update list, you
        have to call xf-load-fonts function yourself. See comments for more
        information.

        *WARNING:*

        Querying server takes enormous time... To save time when you run
        emacs on one type of x-server only, e.g., your workstation, either
        ask your administrator for help, or help yourself in the way
        described in the file header.

        What else? Regular expressions used for font parsing are more
        general than those used in faces.el. Whether I can cope with
        strange fonts, is quite a different matter, though.

        P.S.: If emacs authors already created that kind of code and do not
        release it for some reason, I hope Gods will forgive them.

 ;;; GNU General Public License for more details.

 ;; This code creates dynamically x-fixed-font-alist of all ISO Latin fonts.

 ;; This package may require X11R4 or higher.

 ;; Upon loading the package queries the server (this operation takes
 ;; enormously long time) two times for mono-spaced "m" and "c"
 ;; (cell-based?) fonts, and records the list in the variable
 ;; xf-latin-fonts. Then the function xf-load-fonts creates sorted
 ;; lists of all fonts, divided by encoding type and family. Surplus
 ;; fonts that differ by only resolution and average char width (I had
 ;; no choice, there are too many fonts to accept all) are removed.

 ;; Since some fonts of strange size will never be used anyway, you can
 ;; remove too big or too small fonts. By default, all fonts smaller
 ;; than 10 or bigger than 24 points are removed (see variables below).

 ;; You should call xf-load-fonts by yourself; it can be used only
 ;; once, as the code at the end sets xf-latin-fonts to nil.

 ;; Previously this code created a three-level font list, on the top
 ;; level split according to encoding, but that kind of structure could
 ;; not be handled by x-popup-menu. The drawback of current approach is
 ;; that you can find yourself with the long list of entries starting
 ;; with useless in this case "Latin1" prefix. If you dislike that,
 ;; edit the file.

 ;; To maintain backward compatibility, the very first font on the very
 ;; first sublist is the default font (surprisingly).

 ;; To make use of this code, put in your .emacs the following two lines:
 ;;      (load-file "<the full path to this file on your system>")
 ;;      (xf-load-fonts)

 ;; IMPORTANT:

 ;; To avoid endlessly waiting on every emacs load, do the following:
 ;; 1. Save this file somewhere.
 ;; 2. Start emacs in the following way:
 ;;      > emacs -l path_to_this_file
 ;; 3. After a long time, this will put you into *scratch* buffer. Now type:
 ;;      (xf-load-fonts)
 ;;    and then LFD or ^J and the end of line. This will run the function.
 ;; 4. You will find yourself at the end of the very long single line. Type
 ;;    ^P or up-arrow to go up, then _insert_ at the beginning of the line:
 ;;      (setq x-fixed-font-alist '
 ;;    Remember to put a space between "x-fixed-font-alist" and "'(".
 ;; 5. Jump to the end of line and insert ")". Minibuffer will read:
 ;;      Matches (setq ...
 ;; 6. And now append this _one_ line to your .emacs ... and your done!

    11.1 Setting background colour

        <rollintumb@aol.com> RollinTumb:

        Put into your startup file (I call mine emacs.ini):
        In DOS, you have only 16 colours to choose from.

            (set-face-foreground 'default  "white")
            (set-face-background 'default "blue")

            You can also set colours for other objects/modes:
            (set-face-foreground 'modeline "green")
            (set-face-background 'modeline "black")
            (set-face-foreground 'secondary-selection "white")
            (set-face-background 'secondary-selection "blue")
            (set-face-foreground 'msdos-menu-active-face "blue")
            (set-face-background 'msdos-menu-active-face "cyan")
            (set-face-foreground 'msdos-menu-passive-face "lightgray")
            (set-face-background 'msdos-menu-passive-face "cyan")
            (set-face-foreground 'msdos-menu-select-face "cyan")
            (set-face-background 'msdos-menu-select-face "black")
            (set-face-foreground 'region "cyan")
            (set-face-background 'region "black")

    11.2 Code: pc-win.el

        Eli Zaretskii <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

        Attached please find a replacement for lisp/term/pc-win.el and a
        few lines to put into your _emacs file. Don't forget to
        byte-compile pc-win.el once you install it. The defaults as they
        are set on my system make font-lock the default colouring method,
        but hilit19 will also work once you install these. Enriched Text
        mode should work also. Drop me a note if you have any problems.
        pc-win.el

12.0 Xt/Motif programming and font-lock

        .M. Melgazzi <marco@vcldec1.polito.it>

        I like quite a lot font-lock and, for my thesis work, I use mainly
        c and Xt/Motif. Unluckily, in this package there is no support for
        X keywords so I had to add it myself :)

        This uuencoded file is a snipped down version of my .emacs that
        made me achieve exactly what I wanted: colour syntax highlighting of
        the majority of X types and costants.

        To use it you'll have to edit a little your emacs file: it
        shouldn't be too difficult anyway ( I'm a newbie so don't flame me
        for my efforts :). I had to gzip+uuencode the code because there
        are quite some extra long regexps ( I get a strange warning if I
        compile them on the fly, see the code for info ).

        Of course, if you don't have a very fast machine, I strongly recommend
        fast-lock: especially if you plan to use this file :)
