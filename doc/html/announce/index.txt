        Subject: [ANNOUNCE] tinyirc.el - Emacs utilities for IRC (PasteBot)

        ANNOUNCEMENT: Snapshot of the Emacs interface to IRC PasteBot
        services is available at
        <http://tierra.dyndns.org:81/emacs/pastebot>. This is initial
        release, please send bug reports to the maintainer. Package
        offers a "send" and "receive" commands to handle the pastebot
        messages:

             IRC is very popular method of getting to getter with all sorts
             of activities. For programmers alike, IRC is like 'all united'
             where you get invaluable help from people that happen to be
             online. No need to scratch your head alone; let's scratch
             together in a friendly programming channel.

             Most of the channels do not permit flooding - which means
             copy/pasting many lines (of code) at once. If you do that, the
             bot watching the activities of the channel will kick that
             person out faster than he can blink his eye. So don't do that.
             Read the channel's message what is the etiquette to show your
             code snippet. Previous times it has been a custom to use
             separate #flood channel (which you must join) /join #flood

             And then tell people "Hey, I'm posting the code to #flood, go and
             check". But someone may not be watching the channel's messages at
             the time of announcement and when he finally joins the #flood, he's
             too late. He cannot see the code. The catch is that every
             interested person has be be on channel #flood first before anyone
             pastes a message there. Use cannot see old messages, onle lines
             after his joining the channel.

        Sending Pastebot messages

                There is simple interface: draw region and call `M-x'
                `tinyirc-pastebot-send-region', which you can assign to a
                key. But you can't use that quite yet. Read the preliminary
                settings and test your interface before using this Emacs
                key.

                    ;; Select "C-c p" prefix for pastebot commands
                    (global-set-key "\C-cps" 'tinyirc-pastebot-send-region)

                There are few variables that you might want to set. See
                `tinyirc-:pastebot-program' and
                `tinyirc-:pastebot-config-directory' in case you keep
                configuration files in different directory.

        Receiving pastebot messages

                 Receiving messages announced in the IRC channel is even
                 easier. Call `M-x' `tinyirc-pastebot-receive-url' and
                 offer the URL announced in the channel. A possible key
                 binding for this could be:

                    (global-set-key "\C-cpr" 'tinyirc-pastebot-receive-url)

        For further information refer to manual page available at
        <http://tierra.dyndns.org:81/emacs/pastebot/tinyirc.html>

2000-10-07 Announcement about sourceforge CVS

        [2000-10-07] The sourceforge development hasn't matured yet,
        so this release build is a local copy of current state of the
        project. Many bugs corrected regearding the tinydesk.el and a
        new experimental mail completion features added to
        tinymail.el. - 2000-10-07

        [2000-09-09] This is a transition release that has NOT BEEN
        built from sourceforge CVSTREE. It has been put available so
        that the latest development changes could be tested and used
        by the Emacs audience and avoid the (perhaps) long delay it
        takes to get sourceforge development and builds going. This is
        a complete release including the bin/ doc/ and lip/
        directories. Start at doc/REAME.txt, which unfortunately
        refers to old develoment site and it's practises. Just ignore
        those comments for now. - 2000-09-09

        For bash:

            $ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.tiny-tools.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tiny-tools

        For csh and tcsh:

            % setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@cvs.tiny-tools.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tiny-tools

    2000-09-09 Short description

        Emacs Tiny Tools is a collection of libraries and packages, which
        are designed to be OS (Win32/Unix) and X/Emacs platform
        independent. E.g. configure load-path automatically, URL handler,
        easy-delete, mail complete and many more.

        All the programs and documentation in Tiny Tools kit is released under
        GPL http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

    2000-09-09 The Sourceforge

        The transition

        A work is in progress to move all the development to the well
        known Open Source development server at
        http://www.sourceforge.net/ but the transition will take time
        before a CVS access and package build methods are
        ready. Currently the account is active and the latest releases
        can be found found solely from there.

        The first phase goal: To get the CVS going

        The seconds phase: To get build methods automatic and
        platform independent, anyone with CVS access can start maintain
        the code if the unfortunate case happens that the original
        author resigns (I have no such plans at this time).

        The third phase: Write or move the existing web pages and
        maintain them at sourceforge (requires learning PHP, which2
        I do not master currently) A volunteer or help is welcomed.

    Current project and home page location

        The version numbers in the files are not a continuum of what
        was initially releases in 1994. There has been since several
        moves from RCS to CVS and CVS-servers, Unix to Win32 and
        vice versa and the revisions numbers have been reseted or
        started again. Sometimes there has been a disk crashes which
        has been wiped histories as well.

        So if you see version 1.8, it would be 1.511 or something today.

    2000-09-09 Emacs compatibility

        The minimum criterias are:

            Emacs 20.1+  XEmacs: 20.4+ ( 21.1+ preferred )

        The release MAY WORK FINE with older Emacs releases and if you
        submit bug report, a support for older Emacs versions is considered
        unless there is too much work. The current development platform, where
        the utilities are written and tested is:

            NT Emacs 20.7, and NT XEmacs 21.2.20+

    2000-09-09 Recommended top 10 or so

        Here is selection of the most useful files in the kit. Take a look
        at these first. You are instructed to start with the tinypath.el
        which will solve all Emacs package installation problems system
        wide by finding out the load-path and INFO files automatically. (No
        need to manually edit load-path any more)

        o   tinypath.el - Automatic load-path setup, no matter how deep.
        o   tinyload.el - Lazy load Emacs packages and startup files at
            background
        o   tinyurl.el - Top level umbrella for all URL browsing
        o   tinyigrep.el - Top level umbrella to igrep.el. Grep files easily.
        o   tinymail - Very feature rich TAB completion of any field in mail
        o   tinymy.el - Grab bag of utilities. Watch your mouse when you
            point at the end of window in file buffer.
        o   tinysearch - one key/mouse-click search forward / backward
        o   tinytf - A document writing minor mode. (Technical Format)

2000-06-05 Announcement as posted to gnu.emacs.sources

        DO NOT BOOKMARK absolute site address, because it may move
        without notice. DO NOT DOWNLOAD old kit
        emacs-tiny-tools.tar.gz. It is kept in place, because it was
        the last kit where development was donw in Unix. The old kit
        will be removed when the Beta has been proven stable.

    Mailing list

        There is mailing list for the project, where you can send questions
        and bug reports. The list name is *emacs-tt-users* and the traffic
        in the lists is very occasional:

            http://www.egroups.com/group/emacs-tt-users (See at left "subscribe")

    History

        All the programs and documentation in Tiny Tools kit is
        released under GPL http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

        Tiny Tools is my on-going "hobby", that started with one Emacs
        package, then next .. in 1994 to help me use Emacs more
        conveniently in my daily work.

        Prevous kit was released at the beginning of 1999. The
        development was done in Unix using Emacs 19.28 and 20.1, with
        very little NT Emacs support and ever more little XEmacs
        support (19.14). There has been period of inactivity, due to
        more busy days with my regular work, nice long vacation in
        Spain and moving the development environment from unix to PC.
        The move to PC was more painful than I ever though because all
        the building tools had to be made from scratch. (All my nice
        automatic unix scripts were useless)

    Current release

        W32 users will be more than delighted to hear, that current
        releases are BETA series of Cross platform Emacs / XEmacs /
        W32 / Unix tools.

        XEmacs support is now going strong finally too, even the W32
        XEmacs support.

        Latest Emacs releases are now supported much better, because
        of the availability of precompiled binaries for w32.

    Backward compatibility

        The previous release supported Emacs versions way back to
        19.27 and XEmacs 19.14, but I can't promise such a long
        release backing any more. The minimum criterias for support
        are:

            Emacs 19.34+    ( 20.1+ preferred )
            XEmacs: 20.4+   ( 21.1+ preferred )

        The release MAY WORK FINE with older Emacs releases and if you
        submit bug reports a support for older versions is considered
        unless there are too much work. however, the current
        development is being done in W32 with

            W32 Emacs 20.4, 20.5
            W32 XEmacs 21.1.6, 21.2.20

        W32 Emacs is the current primary development environment.

    Recommended top 10 or so

        Here is my selection of the most useful files in the kit. Take
        a look at these first:

        o   tinypath.el - Automatic load-path setup, no matter how
            deep.
        o   tinyload.el - Lazy load Emacs packages and startup files
            at background
        o   tinyurl.el - Top level umbrella for all URL browsing
        o   tinyigrep.el - Top level umbrella toigrep.el. Grep files
            easily.
        o   tinymail - Very feature rich TAB completion of any field
            in mail
        o   tinymy.el - Grabbag of utilities. Watch your mouse when
            you point modeline
        o   tinysearch - one key/mouse-click search forward / backward
        o   tinytf - A document writing minor mode. (Techical Format)

        The complete list has been attached separatedly.

2000-02-17 ANNOUNCE: instant Java language call syntax help (tinytag.el)

        Hi, [2000-02-17]

        I decided to update one of my packages to support Java call syntax
        in echo-area while you you program. Years ago I had coded the
        support mainly for C/C++, but now I currently code with Java and
        thought it was time to wipe dust off from the old engine.

        What is tinytag.el ? The name "tag" comes from analogy to
        the emacs TAGS packages that cache various language syntax information

        Suppose we have code:

            Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
            long total = rt.totalMemory();
                            *
                            Your cursor is over this function

        After few seconds the modeline will inform you:

            1: java.lang.Runtime  long totalMemory() throws IOException

        What you need:

            1. http://tiny-tools.soourceforge.net/
            2. Perl

        What do you do to get instant help working? Generate Java database:

            You must generate the Java function call database. In Tiny Tools
            kit you find java-function-list.pl which extracts the functions
            out of the standard JDK javadoc pages. This is the database that you
            will be using.

                perl java-function-list.pl --recurse java/sun/jdk1.2.2/docs \
                  > ~/elisp/config/emacs-config-tinytag-jdk1.2.2

            And it generates database in following format. You can edit
            the lines as you wish to supply additional information. There
            is no required line format:

                java.lang.StringBuffer  StringBuffer insert(int offset, Object obj)
                java.lang.StringBuffer  StringBuffer insert(int offset, String str)
                ...
                java.lang.String  String substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) throws UnsupportedEncodingException
                ...

                NOTICE: The System.out.print* functions are not generated (Java
                does not have page for them because they are inherited functions)
                See comments in Perl script's --help and copy the defaults form
                there to the end of generated database.

        Let tinytag.el know that you now have java database available

              ;;  Define two of your own variables

              ;;  The emacs-config-tinytag-jdk1.2.2 file must be located
              ;;  under tinytag-:database-dir which is by default
              ;;  ~/elisp/config or ~/ if config dir did not exist.

              (defconst my-tinytag-:db-map-java
                '((func       "emacs-config-tinytag-jdk1.2.2"))
                "Java database.")

              (defconst my-tinytag-:db-re-java
                '(("."        (func)))
                "Java database.")

              ;;  Now glue your variables to tinytag.el


              (defconst tinytag-:database-setup-table
                (list

                 '("code-java\\|java"
                   (my-tinytag-:db-map-java my-tinytag-:db-re-java))

                  ;; ...other supported languages))

        If everything went ok, you're ready to code with java and "instant help".
        Loading the tinytag.el and configuring the `tinytag-:database-setup-table'
        is enough to activate the package. You can also keep following window
        visible if the echo-area display is not enough:

            *tinytag-output*

        In case of error or nothing happens, please turn on debug:

            M-x tinytag-debug-toggle

        And observe the printed messages in buffer

            *tinytag-debug*

        Please try and give feedback, this is first java support implementation.

        Jari
