    1.1 Audience

        This paper documents the usage of development repository to a
	to a new project member who wishes to participate in
	development.

    1.2 Making releases

        To make a new file releases, follow these steps. We
        suppose that the file where the complete release is named as
        `tiny-tools-YYYY.MMDD.zip' following the ISO 8601 date
        standard and the universal de facto file packaging standard
        PACKAGENAME-VERSION.VERSION[.VERSION]*

	#TODO: change to Savannah instructions

        o   Upload the file to project page.
            PLEASE DO THIS FIRST - YOU WILL PICK FILE LATER.
        o   Login in to your account
        o   Go to project page
        o   Select page "Admin" => "File Releases" from the menus at top
        o   Scroll to the end where you see "File Release Packages"
        o   Select "Add Release" button.
            Fill in "Create new release" with the timestamp YYYY.MMDD.
            Select "Create this release".

        New page opens:

        o   Step 1: Fill in the description to "Release notes"
            Click the button "submit/refresh"
        o   Step 2: Select tiny-tools-YYYY.MMDD.zip
            Click button "add Files and/or Refresh View"
        o   Step 3:
            Processor => Platform independent
            file Type => Source .gz
            Click button "update/refresh"
        o   Step 4: Send message to people monitoring the package.

        RETURN by pressing button "Summary" at the beginning of page.

    1.3 Downloading sources for editing

        You need SSH and Git installed.

        To develop under Windows, install Cygwin
        http://www.cygwin.com/ => See link at the right hand corner
        and download `setup.exe'.

    1.4 Savannah Web page management:

        https://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/HomepageUpload

	Initial: ownloading the CVS structure

	cd doc/
	cvs -f -z3 -d:ext:$USER@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/web/emacs-tiny-tools co emacs-tiny-tools
	mv emacs-tiny-tools www

	After that, just copy *.html files to www

	cd doc/
	tar -cf - $(find src/ -type f -name "*.html") | tar -C www -xf -


    1.5 Project web page locations

	#TODO: change to Savannah instructions

        At project server, web sites are located under /home/groups
        Project FTP Sites are located in
        /home/groups/ftp/pub/p/pr/ROJECT-NAME

            /home/users   : User Based Quota 2MB Soft 4MB Hard
            /home/groups  : Group Based Quota 100MB Soft 125MB Hard

    1.6 Project documentation

	#TODO: change to Savannah instructions

        Visit the project main page <project website>/PROJECT-NAME
        (make sure you have logged in) and select from the left hand
        list *project* *admin*. You arrive to the new page, Scroll to
        the bottom to "Tool Admin" and go to *DocManagerAdmin* and
        fill in the project documentation. BEFORE anything else, you
        must define a document group like _General_.

2.0 Development environment setup information

    2.1 Setting up OpenSSH

          For Unix, get SSH from <http://www.openssh.org/>. OpenSSH is
          already include in the Win32/Cygwin.

        Using SSH is not the most straight forward thing, especially with
        all the protocol version numbers involved. You can easily go wrong or
        wonder why things are not working. Here are some basic instructions
        for OpenSSH, which is different form all other ssh version out
        there. Cygwin includes OpenSSH.

            $ ssh -V        # display ssh version

        Generate two keys, the SSH1 key first:

            $ ssh-keygen    # Proceed as the command suggests

        Then the SSH2 key:

            $ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa -t dsa

        Configure SSH by editing ~/.ssh/config, the protocol line is
        very important.

            Host *
                Protocol                    1,2
                UsePrivilegedPort           no
                Compression                 yes
                CompressionLevel            9
                KeepAlive                   yes
                RhostsAuthentication        yes
                RSAAuthentication           yes
                PubkeyAuthentication        yes
                PasswordAuthentication      yes
                FallBackToRsh               yes
                ForwardX11                  yes
                ForwardAgent                yes

        For Windows, you're set. But if this is Unix, you need to set
        file and directory permission to correct values as well. SSH
        is very picky and won't work correctly if it thinks that the
        permissions are too loose.

            $ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
            $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/identity* ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/id_dsa*

        Final thing, to connect a remote site, you have to CARRY the key
        there. The keys that you will copy to remote site are the SSH1 and
        SSH2 keys you just generated. The files are:

            From (A) site               Copy to (B) site
            ~/.ssh/identity.pub         ~/.ssh/known_hosts
            ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub           ~/.ssh/id_dsa_A_site.pub

        Again, remember to set chmod 600 permission in remote (B) site.
        Now you should be all set to be ready to connect to remote site.
        One final thing, always run all programs under agent, which
        remembers and passes forward your keys (ssh1 and aah2):

            $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/identity ~/.ssh/id_dsa

        After that you can connect to remote site without password, because
        agent makes the hand shake for your with your keys. Run *verbose*
        mode on to pinpoint any troubles with the connection:

            $ ssh -l LOGIN shell.<project site>

        If that works, you can expect that the CVS works without
        password under ssh-agent for your project (REMEMBER: you have
        to send the ~/.ssh/identity.pub through WWW-user-admin page,
        described earlier in this document for CVS to work)

    2.2 Bash admin utilities

        Under `bin/admin.bashrc' there is administrative file that
        automates project tasks.  Follow the instruction in the file.

    2.3 Making Debian packages

        First, become a debian developer by reading this document
        http://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/index.en.html

        The initial debian package skeleton was generated with following manner

            <download the latest release>
            $ mv tiny-NNNN.NNNN emacs-tiny-tools-NNNN.NNNN
            $ cd emacs-tiny-tools-NNNN.NNNN
            $ export DEBFULLNAME="Firstname Surname"
            $ dh_make --single --email EMAIL --copyright gpl

End
