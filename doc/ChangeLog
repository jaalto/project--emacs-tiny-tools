        as 3 years ago. Currently mostly bug fixes and small
        enhancements are planned. Added 'News' update 2003-05. Reorganized
        links and descriptions at the top of file. Removed cvs not
        'A mall glitch' from the end of page. Removed link to
        http://www.cvshome.org/dev/codewindow.html because Cygwin and
        official CVS site is more preferred. Updated 'Operating system'
        section to tell about Cygwin support.
