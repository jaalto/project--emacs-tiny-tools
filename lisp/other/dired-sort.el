;;; Commentary:

;;
;;  Preface, Nov 1997
;;
;;      Not much to say. I have had this package lying in my lisp directory
;;      since Emacs 18.xx days. When I noticed that this package doesn't
;;      exist in the OHIO archive, neither did the ftpsearch locate it,
;;      I decided to clen it up and put publically available.
;;
;;      The original author is unknown And the only thing that was in the
;;      original documentation was this line:
;;
;;      $Header: /tmp_mnt/am/p7/utility/gmacs/f2/RCS/dired-resort.el,v
;;      1.1 88/11/03 13:22:08 fad Exp $
;;
;;  New bindings in dired
;;
;;      When you load this file, function `dired-sort-default-keys' is called.
;;      The following bindings to dired mode are defined.
;;
;;          S" "    dired-sort-resort    (that's an "S" + SPACE)
;;          Ss      dired-sort-by-size
;;          Sd      dired-sort-by-date
;;          Sf      dired-sort-by-field
;;          Sn      dired-sort-by-name
