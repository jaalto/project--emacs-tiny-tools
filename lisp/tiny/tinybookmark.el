;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, feb 1995
;;
;;      Long ago I used a little function I wrote that inserted section
;;      breaks, those that I call `book' `marks'. There was also
;;      `folding.el' to keep the code in separate sections. Findings things
;;      was easy when you just searched either book marks or jumped between
;;      folds. Next *imenu.el* was announced which provided X-pop up for
;;      book marks and adding support to it was the start of this package.
;;
;;  Overview of features
;;
;;      o   Provide 'setting book marks' functions: Add
;;          repeated characters and sequences up till end of line with
;;          named identifier.
;;      o   Automatically parse book marks from file, if it contains
;;          identifier `bookMarkRegexp' which defines book mark syntax for
;;          the file. Uses X-popup [imenu] to show those book marks and
;;          moving between them.
;;
;;  How to keep files organized
;;
;;      There are several tools to keep your code organized and they are at
;;      their best if you think how they can co-operate. There is
;;      *folding.el* and *tinybookmark.el*, which might seem to do double
;;      job, since they both divide code into more easily manageable
;;      sections. The key point is that when folding is used, one works
;;      _within_ some special section and possibly want to hide all the
;;      rest of the code. But when jumping easily back and forth on the
;;      buffer, it us *unfolded* and TinyBookmark is used. Now, to confuse
;;      you more, there is also *imenu.el* which can be used to jump inside
;;      code. It can be configured so that it will pick all function names
;;      inside list, and when you want to go to specific function, just
;;      pick one from imenu.
;;
;;      To summarize:
;;
;;      o   folding.el      - For hide unneeded code,
;;                            clear view on the structure
;;      o   tinybookmark.el - Jump between/finding  _large_ code sections
;;      o   imenu.el        - Finding specific function, more detailed control.
;;      o   tinyhotlist.el  - Add/remove files from permanent X-popup list
;;
;;  How to use this package
;;
;;      There is following function that inserts book mark on the current line
;;
;;          M-x tinybookmark-insert
;;
;;      There is also normal repeat function, that fills line with your
;;      pattern:
;;
;;          M-x tinybookmark-repeat
;;
;;      Normally the usual book mark separator is the "." <dot> , which
;;      isn't so "noisy" as continuous '-' line. Normally you add some
;;      unused ID character, like '&' at front of real book mark, like
;;      this:
;;
;;          ;;; .................................. &How-to-use ...
;;          (defun test ()
;;           (progn
;;            ..
;;            (goto-char ..
;;            ;; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ sepratorInsideCode ^^^
;;
;;      The `How-to-use' is book mark, because it has `&' on it, whilst the
;;      latter isn't -- it is used inside code to make it more readable and
;;      The latter on is not included in *imenu*.
;;
;;  About the book mark identifier naming
;;
;;      When you name the breaks, keep in mind that when identifiers are
;;      sorted, the ones that start with big letters A-Z show up first, a-z
;;      come next. Allthougt it would be convenient to have all subwords in
;;      capital, it is usually better to start with lowercase letter,
;;      because it's easily unintentionally mix up/down case letters.
;;      Besides you have to reah out for shift to have uppercase.
;;
;;          ............. breakName ...         ;prefered, starting low
;;          ............. BreakName ...         ;watch out for mixed case!
;;
;;      It is also adviced that you choose some common beginning for the
;;      identifier, so that they get sorted nicely. If you define variables
;;      at the beginning of file it might be good idea to attach beginning
;;      letter like `v-' for variables before the real identifier name
;;      begins, like:
;;
;;          ............. v-globals ...
;;          ............... v-hooks ...
;;
;;      Of course, we can now use the uppercase letter trick to have them
;;      sorted first in the list, just change `v-' to `V-'. Generally
;;      you should think which ones do you use most, do you leave the
;;      variables alone when you have defined them and mostly work with new
;;      functions? Then the variables can stay at the end of list and
;;      there is no need for `V-' trick. but if you need to access
;;      variables often, then you might want to see variables first in the
;;      list. It's up to your decision how you name the variables and how
;;      you want to see them listed.
;;
;;  Breaks and sub-break naming
;;
;;      If you have very large file, you'll probably need major breaks,
;;      level one breaks and possibly level 2 breaks too. To keep the list
;;      well sorted, put the functions into bigger groups and name the
;;      sub-level breaks so that they have some common beginning in respect
;;      to the major break they belong to. Let's see an example where
;;      you're dealing with mail handling. Notice the CAPITAL letter.
;;
;;          ;; ################################# &h-Header ###
;;          ;;  this is beginning block of header handling
;;
;;          ;; ..................................... &h-cc ...
;;          ;;  Some special function here to handle CC
;;          ;;  field, killing all recipients, or only
;;          ;;  some of them
;;
;;          ;; .. .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. .
;;          ;;  More detailed functions under h-cc, Not
;;          ;;  named, because there is only 2 function
;;
;;      Again there are couple of points to follow here. All the tricks are
;;      discussed already: the `Big' letter trick put's major break to the
;;      top of imenu list, common beginning keeps the subsections together.
;;
;;  Example breaks
;;
;;      Some book mark breaks are proposed here, but you can use whatever you
;;      like. Thumb of rule: be consistent, always use same convention in
;;      your files and consider the "level of noisiness" of your breaks, so that
;;      they build up nicely and the code is easy to read. Too many
;;      _different_ breaks is not good idea, because they clutter the view
;;      fast, instead use variations on a theme: same break character but
;;      varying spaces and continuous character lengths.
;;
;;      Thumb rule: select 1-3 break chars, and never change them in you
;;      files; your files look alike. Vary the spacing, not the break
;;      characters.
;;
;;      These are 'noisy breaks' , Major section separators, pick only one
;;      and use it in your files, do not use all three!

;;
;;     Book Mark Cache
;;
;;      So that imenu works fast, it is not desirable that the breaks are
;;      always parsed from scratch, because it takes time to scan the file
;;      for possible book marks. That's why the information is cached. If
;;      the break cache is empty, the breaks are gathered from buffer and
;;      stored to the cache and when you call the imenu, the cache is
;;      offered to it --> fast response time. When you add new breaks to
;;      the buffer [especially at the beginning of code development], you
;;      may want to call function `tinybookmark-parse' which will empty the
;;      cache and re-read all book marks. If you write lot of code the
;;      points that were cached do no longer represent exact points of book
;;      marks, because they have been sliding off their places. If you want
;;      *always* have updated book mark points, there is variable
;;      `tinybookmark-cache-update' which you can set to 'always, if you
;;      want the cache to be updated always prior showing X-menu. In large
;;      buffer this remarkably slows down the menu appering. See variable
;;      for more choices.
;;
;;  Automatic book mark detection
;;
;;      In order book marks to be detected in file, you may define following
;;      RCS identifier [see ident(1)] preferably at the beginning of your
;;      file:
;;
;;          $BookMarkRegexp:<space>'REGEXP'<space>$
;;
;;      Be careful so that the identifier is _exactly_ in this form: pay
;;      attention to spaces and (') around the REGEXP. The regular
;;      expression tells what line can be considered as book mark and the
;;      book mark name is indicated in subexpression 1 [\\(.*\\)] , look at
;;      this file, how it is constructed. In order to find all book marks
;;      and build up the cache, it needs to widen the buffer in case the
;;      file is narrowed with some folding or outline editor. When the
;;      cache has been built the buffer's narrowing is restored, so you
;;      shouldn't even notice this. Of course you don't want to find book
;;      marks from your RMAIL file.
;;
;;      One word about the regexp construction, let's see regexp that
;;      matches the identifier:
;;
;;          &+\\([^ ]+\\)
;;
;;      Pay attention to using exclusive regexp, not just '.*'
;;      construction. When you use folding or outline editor the '.*' form
;;      is very ill behaving, because if the line being scanned is
;;      currently folded, IT WILL MATCH WHOLE folded section --> your
;;      identifier surely isn't that one. We can't unfold the sections
;;      during scanning, because if there are subfolds, what editor is on
;;      use .. it's too complex/slow to handle such situations. But using
;;      the exclusive list [^ ] will surely match the identifier, because
;;      it stops when it can find first space. This means that you can't
;;      use _spaces_ inside the identifiers. Cat the words together.
;;
;;  If the BookMarkRegexp isn't defined in file
;;
;;      Then the programs tries to search for the default book marks.
;;      See function `tinybookmark-regexp-default' for more.
;;
;; Message: Empty cache. Building...
;;
;;      Do you wonder why you get this message displayed, while you were
;;      sure that you the buffer had cache already? Don't be surprised. This
;;      is totally normal behavior: whenever you switch mode for the
;;      buffer the new mode _kills_ all local variables, including cache
;;      information. Obviously the information must be restored when you
;;      call the hot list again. The cache could have been programmed to be
;;      buffer local, but in the present format only one cache s active at
;;      the time. This was simpler to implement and manage in the code.
;;
;;  About imenu
;;
;;      You definitely want to look at the documentation of imenu to find
;;      many more usages for it. It makes your day shine in X-display. You
;;      should also configure few variables for it, like:
;;
;;          (setq imenu-max-items 20)
;;
;;  Test run
;;
;;      Load this file and set those key bindings mentioned. Hit the mouse
;;      bindings and you're running book mark package. Since the break
;;      marks are used in commentary also, the list of book marks are not
;;      in their most informative form, I use following convention to name
;;      book marks;
;;
;;          'v-'     variable topic
;;          't-'     text topic
;;
;;  Design thoughts
;;
;;      Sooner or later someone wonders: "Can't we have sub-breaks listed
;;      nicely with indentation in front lines in X-popup?" Present answer
;;      "No", since it would require keeping track of the 'Main break' and
;;      then seeing if there exist sub-breaks. Immediately this leads to
;;      question "What is the main break?", and if we say main breaks start
;;      with "#|/%" character set we limit the use of breaks. Besides deciding
;;      what are sub-breaks, main-breaks with regexp may be too slow.
;;      The breaks are intended to to give an *overview* of the buffer.
;;      Please use imenu to find single functions if you don't feel like
;;      tapping couple of pgUp/pgDown after the point is positioned in the break
;;      section.
