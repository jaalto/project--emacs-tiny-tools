;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, overview of features
;;
;;      o   Determines how much text should be eaten around current cursor
;;          position. Eat extra spaces, extra newlines, next word
;;          next statement, next comment ... whatever is appropriate
;;      o   Can also eat inside mixed case word: WordsThatAreLikeThis
;;      o   Yank and "overwrite" text under cursor with Meta mouse-2 or
;;          `Meta' `C-y'. (Std Emacs in `overwrite-mode' doesn't allow you to
;;          yank and overwrite at the same time.)
;;
;;  Hint for the Minibuffer
;;
;;      If using Windowed Emacs and the prompt is at minibuffer and
;;      you would like to clean the whole prompt, hit key
;;      `Esc-backspace'. In non-windowed emacs, you have to repeat the
;;      keystroke as needed (this is due to "backspace key detection
;;      problem syndrome").
;;
;;  Non-windowed and Windowed Emacs
;;
;;      This package works _best_ in windowed Emacs, because in
;;      windowed environment you can use the modifiers *Control*,
;;      *Alt* and *Meta* freely with the backspace key. The idea of
;;      this package is to overload your single key, `backspace', as
;;      much as possible with various delete functionalities.
;;      The differences to non-windowed environment are as follows.
;;      Key marked with (*) is not available under non-window system.
;;
;;                          was             now

;;
;;  Story behind this package
;;
;;      One day the developer got frustrated of moving cursor around the
;;      point and using keys del or backspace to write C++ and LISP
;;      symbols. The start situation was like this while cursor was at (*):
;;
;;          (defun lisp-symbol-name-myname          ()
;;                                  *
;;
;;      He decided to change 'myname' to something else. Normally he
;;      would reach out for M-d for `kill-word' to delete `myname' and
;;      type the new name:
;;
;;          (defun lisp-symbol-name-mynew           ()
;;                                       *
;;
;;      Next, he noticed that there were extra spaces involved.
;;      A call to `fixup-whitespace' would make it go away ... Hmm that was
;;      not bound to any key by default (in this particular Emacs used
;;      at the time), so he had to type it the long way round: `M-x'
;;      `fixup-whitespace'. His thoughts were: "Oh, I should have bound it
;;      to some easily reacheable key". The story continues.
;;      He looked at the function once more and decided that the name
;;      `symbol-name-mynew' wasn't a good one after all. He decided to
;;      delete 3 words backward. Now, how do you do that?
;;
;;          (defun lisp-symbol-name-mynew ()
;;                                       *
;;
;;      He murmurs, "where is the command to delete backward ...". After
;;      spending valuable minutes to find the `delete-backward-word'
;;      command with the `M-x' `apropos',  hitting the page up and down
;;      to find anything that would look like what he wanted, he leaned
;;      back with despair, "Doh, there is no such command". Silently
;;      he ends up tapping the backspace until he reaches the correct point:
;;
;;          (defun lisp- ()
;;                      *
;;
;;      and starts typing a new name...
;;
;;          (defun lisp-my-func ()
;;
;;      All is perfect for a moment. Then, he notices that there are too
;;      many newlines above the newly created function and says to himself:
;;      "I really should delete those 5 extra empty lines above the
;;      function. Now, how do I kill backward 5 empty lines backward? The
;;      `kill-line' in C-k kills only forward" ...". The story teller
;;      rests here and leaves reader's imagination to fly forward.
;;
;;  Lesson learned
;;
;;      As you can notice, people often spend most of the time to
;;      position the cursor to the right spot and deleting text over
;;      there.. over here .. typing more .. changing our mind ... and
;;      so on.
;;
;;      It was time to do something creative, so that user wouldn't have to
;;      worry about the deletion of text so much. This package provides
;;      atempts to provide _smart_ deleting capabilities: whether it was
;;      to delete forward of backward. Naturally the art of deletion is
;;      not accurate, a few guesses need to be made and they may be
;;      wrong. If it so happens that a lot of text have suddenly
;;      retired (vanished, vaporized) from the buffer, remember, there
;;      is no need to panic. Emacs has friendly `undo' (C-_ or C-x u).

;;                                    To zap whole line
;;
;;      Chunk delete: words, spaces, symbols ...
;;
;;          <            >            <>                 \/ /\
;;          M-Backspace  C-backspace  S-Backspace        C-M-d  / C-S-backspace

;;          M-SPC        tinyeat-delete-whole-word
;;
;;      These function have no defult binding in `tinyeat-install', but
;;      you might consider finding a suitable key bindings for them:
;;
;;         M-x tinyeat-erase-buffer
;;         M-x tinyeat-kill-buffer-lines-main
;;
;;  Known Bugs
;;
;;      This package heavily relies on various modifiers that can be
;;      attached to the *BACKSPACE* key. Binding the backspace can be
;;      a difficult subject under Unix. For example the *Alt* (Meta)
;;      key may not be recognized under terminala. It may be possible
;;      to make backspace known by exming the key events with xev(1)
;;      and makign the needed modification to environment with
;;      `xmodmap(1)' or `keycaps(1)'. In some terminals that Alt-key
;;      simply won't be seen and the Meta-key substitute o use ESC
;;      under Emacs is not really practical in the sense where this
;;      package was developed: for quick editing.
;;
;;      Worse, in the same environment Emacs and XEmacs may disagree
;;      what BACKSPACE means. An example: here are the results from
;;      XEmacs 20.4 and Emacs 20.3 under Redhat Linux 6.2:
;;
;;                              XEmacs          Emacs
;;
;;          <esc backspace>     M-backspace     ESC DEL
;;          <shift backspace>   delete          S-delete
;;          <alt backspace>     <nothing>       <nothing>
;;
;;      There is nothing this package can do to cope with these
;;      changes in key symbol or the environment chnages. If you can,
;;      try to get the ALT and and SHIFT-modifiers working for use
;;      with backspace and everything is well. If that is not
;;      possible, the power of the predefined keybindings are mostly
;;      left unused and you have to find alternative key combinations.
