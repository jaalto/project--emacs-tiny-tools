;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, Aug 1997
;;
;;      In gnu newsgroup there was a request that a class had been used to
;;      using Windows notepad and in order to make the transition to Emacs
;;      smooth, Emacs should have some notepad emulation mode so that
;;      pupils wouldnn't get lost completely in new envinronment. And here
;;      is it, a small notepad emulation. It installs one new menu to Emacs
;;      menu bar which is arranged exactly like the Windows notepad. I have
;;      included only the commands that are directly available from inside
;;      emacs and e.g. 'printer setup' is something that is not found there.
;;      But in order to be complete emulation, all the choices as in normal
;;      notepad are available.
;;
;;  Overview of features
;;
;;      o   Minor mode, but once turned on, occupies every emacs buffer
;;          until turned off.
;;      o   Adds menu 'TinyPad' which contains identical
;;          menu definitions that are found from Winbdows notepad
;;      o   The keybindings use `Meta' as the Alt key to access the
;;          menu items, so you may need to configure your keyboard
;;          with 'xmodmap' in order to get 'Alt' key produce `Meta'
;;      o   Windows specific commands are not emulated, like
;;          `Print' 'Setup'.
;;      o   Following famous windows shortcut keys are not
;;          Emulated; I was lazy and didn't try to reorganize the
;;          Emacs keys. Erm, for now you have to stick to Emacs
;;          equivalents and live without these.
;;
;;          Undo   in   Control-z
;;          Cut    in   Control-x
;;          Copy   in   Control-c
;;          Paste  in   Control-v
;;
;;  Code note
;;
;;      Why on earth I made this package to use "global" minor mode?
;;      I can't remember the reason. A simple menubar entry may have
;;      sufficed just fine. Oh, it was that remaping the bindings.
;;      You see, when minor mode is turned on, it conquers the mappings
;;      underneath.
;;
;;      [1997-10-23] Hey, I just saw pointer to package `Map-zxcv.el' which
;;      takes care of mapping the missing zxcv, so I don't have to bother
;;      with those here. Nice. You can ask it from Kim F. Storm
;;      <storm@olicom.dk>

This mode is global to all buffers; allthough it is a minor mode.

Notice that the keybindings follow the Windows convention; where the
prefix key accesses each submenu; Like Meta-e accesses (e)edit menu.
If your physical Alt key in your keyboard does not produce `Meta'
code; then you use ESC to access e.g. Meta-e. Consult the Emacs Faq's
how you can make your Alt key produce Meta, so that the keybindings work
like in Windows.
