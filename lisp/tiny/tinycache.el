;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, overview of features
;;
;;      This package is meant to be used with `dired' and compilation
;;      buffers. When you load file from either one, the file is
;;      "remembered". This way you can browse bunch of files easily and
;;      when you have finished you can flush the cache and get rid of all
;;      vieved files.
;;
;;  Dired description
;;
;;      When you load a file from dired with `dired-view-file', the
;;      file is remembered. You can load several files for viewing and when you
;;      have finished, call `tinycache-flush' (Defaults to `C-c' `k' in
;;      dired) to remove all the remembered (cached) files from emacs.
;;
;;      This way you don't end up having files that you're not interested
;;      in any more. Using the cache makes browsing bunch of files very
;;      easy. Each dired buffer has it's own cache. The cache is also
;;      flushed if you kill the dired buffer.
;;
;;  Compilation cache description
;;
;;      Maintain also a cache of buffers visiting files via the
;;      `next-error' and `compile-goto-error' commands; each compile/grep
;;      buffer has its own cache.  To kill the cached buffers manually, use
;;      `C-c' `C-d' (compile-flush-cache) in the compile/grep buffer;
;;      deleting the compile/grep buffer automatically kills the cached
;;      buffers.  To disable the cache, set `compilation-find-file-cache'
;;      to a non-list value (e.g. 'disable).
;;
;;      After loading this file, every file that is loaded by calling some
;;      compile function, i.e. `compile-goto-error', is cached if it is not
;;      in emacs already. I.e. when you fix some small errors in other
;;      files, you may not want to keep those files in emacs after you've
;;      done; remember, those got loaded during the calls to
;;      compile-goto-error. The easiest way to get rid of these extra
;;      files, that were not originally in emacs, is to:
;;
;;          A. kill compilation buffer, C-x k *compilation*
;;          B. Call M-x tinycache-flush directly
;;
;;      See *igrep.el* also how you can browse (grep) files easily and when
;;      you've done, you can call this package top get rid of those browsed
;;      files.
;;
;;  Cache minor mode indication --  Controlling the cache flag
;;
;;      Mode line indication shows for loaded buffer
;;
;;          "+C"    if file is loaded as cached.
;;          "+c"    If you have manually turned off the cache
;;
;;      And for root buffer where the file were loaded, normally
;;      compilation or dired buffer, the mode line shows
;;
;;          "+CN"  where N is number of files currently in the cache
;;
;;      Sometimes you want to keep some file that belongs to the cache
;;      and you don't want to loose it when you execute `M-x' `tinycache-flush'
;;      or when you kill the root buffer.
;;
;;      For that purpose there is function `tinycache-mode' to turn
;;      off the cache for current buffer. When the cache mark says
;;      "+c" in the mode line, it tells you that the file will not be
;;      killed when you `tinycache-flush' is called.
;;
;;      Note: the root buffer's xx count is not updated when you kill
;;      buffer that was cached. So if the count says 10, and you kill 3
;;      files that, the count will still still say 10. The count is
;;      updated only when you load some *new* file from the root buffer.
;;      At that time all the buffers cached are checked and the ones that
;;      do not exist any more are removed.
;;
;;  Buffer list commands
;;
;;      There are some additional commands added to buffer list which
;;      helps you to keep track of the cached files better. The "c"
;;      prefix is chosen for (c)ache related commands.
;;
;;          C-c c m     mark all cached files
;;          C-c c d     mark as deleted
;;          C-c c u     unmark cached files.
;;
;;  Dired mode commands
;;
;;      Similar to buffer list, there is some dired commands too
;;
;;          C-c c k     tinycache-flush, remove all cached files from this dired
;;          C-c c m     tinycache-dired-mark
;;          C-c c u     tinycache-dired-unmark
;;
;;  Thanks
;;
;;      Kevin Rodgers, his *igrep.el* gave me an idea for this. The
;;      original cache code from where this package evolved was
;;      written by Kevin under name *compile-cache.el*
