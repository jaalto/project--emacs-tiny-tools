;;  Preface, Sep 1994
;;

;;      In 1994-10-18 Era Eriksson wrote in gnu.emacs.help that he didn't
;;      like 'modes' because they redefined his tab key strangely. What he
;;      wanted was tab 8 in _every possible case_. He wrote: "..if mode
;;      messes with tab key, I don't want it". He also wanted his comments
;;      always to be positioned at column 56 (tab #7). The problem was that
;;      how he could he add comments with tab key, when the mode occied it
;;      already. He also always used to program using `fundamental-mode';
;;      what a cool dude. As a result this package was born. The
;;      original lisp file sent  to Era was posted under name
;;      general-comment.el.
;;
;;  What's this all about, short introduction
;;
;;      Let's see...You're in C/C++ mode, and want to switch to better mode
;;      before starting to adjust comments. But wait, the new mode doesn't
;;      know about C++-comments! Or if you're editing ~/.Xdefauls, there is
;;      no mode for it (at the time of writing), no-one to know the comment
;;      syntax. Boom. Now it's time to give this packet a run. It hooks
;;      itself directly to `\M-;' replacing any previous function. The
;;      packages defines comment syntax and position on the fly when it can
;;      identify the file name. If the file isn't known then it passes
;;      control to mode to handle the commenting. This is handy in
;;      temporary buffers that do not have filename: e.g. *scratch* buffer.
;;      Repetitive calls to `M-;' shift between comment *classes*: comment
;;      is adjusted according to previous one, or move it on the line.
;;
;;  Overview of features
;;
;;      o   Replaces `M-;' comment key. Suitable for any major mode.
;;      o   Determine comment variables on the fly, no matter where you
;;          are or what mode you are using.
;;      o   There is no-list that tells not to touch this mode's commenting.
;;          This is for modes that has `comment-end' which aren't supported.
;;      o   Repetitive `M-;' converts single comment into *bigger* *classes*.
;;      o   Position new comment on empty line by looking at previous
;;          comment.
;;      o   It is possible to define column position for those comments
;;          that are not allowed to move This handy for long lines
;;          or special comments.
;;      o   If there are multiple so called comments, like $#var # comment
;;          in `perl-mode', the last # char is treated as a comment.
;;
;;  Limitations
;;
;;      This isn't designed for modes that have `comment-end', you get
;;      only '/* */' string e.g. in C-mode and no comment class shifting.
;;
;;  Examples
;;
;;      At the end of file there is simple general editing mode, which can
;;      be used for perl, shells, awk, C++ [sometimes]

  Overview of features:

        o   Determines comment variables on the fly, no matter where you
            are or what mode you are.
        o   There is no-list that tells not to touch this mode's commenting.
            This is for modes that has comment-end. TIC can't handle those.
        o   Repetitive M-; converts single comments into 'bigger classes'
        o   Positions new comment on empty line by looking at previous
            comment.
        o   You can define column position for those comments that are not
            allowed to move This handy for long lines or special comments.
        o   If there are multiple 'comments' , like $#var # comment
            in perl-mode, TIC picks the last # char and treats
            it as a comment. Emacs commention cope similar situations.")

(defun tinycomment-adjust-comment ()
  "Introduce a comment or convert an already existing comment to next class.
These are the known comment classes:

        1-- Left margin             ;; omitted if there is CODE on the line
        2-- indented like code
        3-- on comment column

Suggested usage: while writing your code, trigger this command repeatedly
until you are satisfied with the comment.

Comment on its own line note:

- Following lines has two comment chars `#', I call it double commented line.
              # comment text # more text
              # set myVariable = 100;      # temporarily commented
  Because it is hard to know if the line is `full comment' as in case 1, or
  has \\='code temporarily commented out' as line 2, we always consider
  line as `full comment' if line starts with `comment-start'.

- In this case whole line moves when converting to classes.

Code note:

- `tinycomment-set-com' is used instead of standard `indent-for-comment'.
-  Considered adding 4th choice: indent like previous comment,
   but I decided 4th choice or 4 taps was too much...3 seemed ideal,
   so I left it out from `full comment line'."
