;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, May 1996
;;
;;      I was in the middle of testing one of my new packages which
;;      didn't quite work as I wanted. I was loading all kinds of
;;      libraries to see if it breaks. I watched the *Message* buffer
;;      to fill with statements like:
;;
;;          Loading abbrev...
;;          Loading abbrev...done
;;          ...
;;          Loading rmail...
;;          loading rmail done...
;;          ...
;;
;;      But suddendly the Emacs died. It kicked me off to the shell and I
;;      had no idea what package was the last one that got loaded.
;;
;;      You see, the *Message* buffer keeps growing, but you have to tap
;;      the PgDown key to get to the end, all the time. Instead I decided
;;      to pull out some lisp to do general auto-scrolling for any buffer,
;;      so that I can just sit back and watch the buffer move. No more
;;      guessing in *Message* buffer what was the last message before
;;      Emacs went down.
;;
;;  Overview of features
;;
;;      o   Select buffer, and hit auto scroll on/off. You can scroll any
;;          buffer.
;;      o   All windows for the buffer are scrolled in all frames.
;;          If frame is minized and contains window to sroll, frame will
;;          be maximized ("popped up")
;;      o   If buffer's point-max doesn't move, scroll is ignored.
;;      o   Default scroll is activate for: *Compilation* *Grep* and *Messages*
;;
;;  How to use this package
;;
;;      The scroling here is based on timers, where the lowest
;;      interval can be one 1 second. This means that you don't get
;;      smooth and continuous scrolling, but regular update of the
;;      buffer, which may in rare cases seem jerky. However, using
;;      timers is the only possibility if we want to have general
;;      scroll utility for *any* buffer.
;;
;;      To enable/disable auto-scroll for current buffer, use these:
;;
;;          M-x tinyscroll-control      ;to activate scroll
;;          C-u M-x tinyscroll-control  ;to deactivate scroll
;;
;;  Lowest window of the same buffer always scrolls
;;
;;      It is an interesting problem, when you have SAME buffer in multiple
;;      windows, to decide which window to scroll. I didn't want to scroll
;;      all windows, since otherwise I wouldn't have used two/or more
;;      windows for the same buffer.
;;
;;      I decided that the lowest window for the buffer always
;;      scrolls. This can't be configured due to the design decision.
;;      Try to arrange your windows so that the scrolling one goes to
;;      the bottom.

  Overview of features

        o   Select buffer, and hit auto scroll on/off. You can scroll any
            buffer.
        o   If there are multiple windows for the same buffer, scroll only the
            bottom one. --> you can have \"permanent\" look window, while
            the buffer scrolls in other window.
        o   Smart scrolling: if buffer's point-max doesn't move, it ignores
            scrolling. This way you can browse buffer after there is
            no more output to window.
