;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Preface, 1998
;;
;;      This is a lisp function library, package itself does nothing.
;;      This library defines some Emacs backward compatibility function.
;;
;;  Notrs
;;
;;      In 2010 these function were moved here from tinylibb.el.

;;; Change Log:

;;; Code:

(require 'tinyliba)
(provide 'tinylibw)
