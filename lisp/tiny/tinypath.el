;;      ********************************************************************
;;

;;
;;      Create a directory where the cache information is saved. The location

;;      pathname + file-prefix. The cache size depends on your
;;      installed files, with 600 directories and 8000 lisp files, the
;;      cache size is around 500k and if you use compression, it takes
;;      somewhere 200k.
;;
;;          mkdir -p ~/elisp/config     (or ~/.emacs.d/config)
;;
;;  Transparent compression
;;
;;      If space is tight, this package supports transparent
;;      compression. The files can be kept in compressed format
;;      without touching code in startup files. Calls like below are
;;      interpreted as if there were a `.el.gz' or `.el.bz2'
;;      extensions attached to the files. See
;;      `tinypath--compressed-file-extensions' for more.
;;
;;          (load "some-file")
;;          (require 'somefile)
;;
;;      This transparent support however comes with a prolonged search
;;      time, because more attempts must be made in order to find the
;;      file. If all the files are in non-compressed format and you do
;;      not plan to use the compression support, a much better
;;      performancs can be achieved by turning the support off (it's
;;      off by default). To turn it on, use:
;;
;;          (setq tinypath--compression-support 'default)
;;
;;  Contact and support
;;
;;      Call `tinypath-debug-test-run' if you think there is something
;;      odd going on. All the messages will appear in *Messages*
;;      buffer (Emacs); under XEmacs, examine " *Message-Log*"
;;      buffer. If you have any questions, contact maintainer and
;;      don't forget to send contents of the *Messages* buffer.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Preface Feb 1999 - How it all begun
;;
;;      When you have set up your Emacs installation to your liking, a day
;;      comes when you decide that it's time to seriously reconsider the
;;      directory structure of your installed lisp packages. At start, it
;;      is customary to use simple file hierarchy where all private
;;      packages are installed under:
;;
;;          ~/elisp    (in new Emacs: ~/.emacs.d)
;;
;;      Bigger packages are usually installed directly under their release
;;      directories:
;;
;;          ~/elisp/packages/bbdb-2.00.06/
;;          ~/elisp/packages/psgml-1.0.3/
;;          ~/elisp/packages/pcl-cvs-2.9.2/
;;
;;      A more sophisticated way is to use symlinks to the latest
;;      versions, so that you don't have to change `load-path' every
;;      time you install a new version. It is only matter of updating
;;      the symlink:
;;
;;          ~/elisp/packages/foo  --> ~/elisp/packages/foo-2.9.2
;;          |
;;          This path is in the `load-path'
;;
;;      In network, where Windows is coupled with Unix workstations via SAMBA,
;;      you may have mapped some disk, say H:, to you Unix _$HOME_:
;;
;;          H:  --> Unix $HOME  \\SERVER\DIRECTORY\YOUR-LOGIN-DIR
;;
;;      Now, there is a catch when Unix symlinks are used in `$HOME/elisp'
;;      and the directories are accessed from Windows. Having set PC's
;;      HOME environment variable to point to H:, Emacs can start reading
;;      Unix `$HOME/.emacs' startup file, but there appeared messages
;;      like "Can't load library xxx", which was soon followed by
;;      bigger concerns: "autoloading xxx failed". The problem was the
;;      mounted H: disk. You see, PC's network mount can't distinguish
;;      symlinked directories from real directories, so all symlinked Unix
;;      directories in `load-path' were dead. And that's why most of the
;;      files couldn't be found any more.
;;
;;     The conclusions
;;
;;      For cross platform solution it is best not to rely on symlinks,
;;      because they don't work well over a Windows mounts. Secondly,
;;      updating `load-path' should not be needed by hand after a new
;;      package installation, after a directory name change, after
;;      directory structure change, etc. A dream package would solve this
;;      all and do the hard work: "There, that is the root(s) of all Emacs
;;      lisp, go and search all the directories and update `load-path'"
;;
;;      That was what this package originally was all about. Later it
;;      evolved to contains a little more than that. The `load-path'
;;      is updated automatically without any manual work. Only the
;;      start ROOT path(s) of installed lisp hierarchies need to be
;;      known. This package is highly effective: scanning thousands of
;;      files in a matter of seconds and once the cache has been
;;      created, it takes only a snap to load it in next sessions. All
;;      `require' and `load' commands also execute faster than
;;      previously, because the information about existing files is
;;      immediately available. The speedup is helped through advised
;;      functions.
;;
;;  Overview of features
;;
;;     Automatic load-path configuration
;;
;;      o   Define list of `root' directories of your Emacs lisp and this
;;          package will recursively add directories which contain .el or
;;          .elc files to `load-path'
;;      o   A cache is utilized to remember previous scan and
;;          expired periodically. Using cache speeds up loading files
;;          considerably if you have many directories. The number of lisp
;;          directories doesn't affect the load performance.
;;          This is accomplished by using extra advice code in functions:
;;          `load', `load-library', `require', `locate-library' and
;;          `autoload'.
;;      o   When Emacs becomes idle (some 15 minutes of idle time) the
;;          cache and `load-path' is validated for erroneous entries and
;;          rebuilt as needed. This feature should auto-detect changes in
;;          directory structure and help semi auto-installing
;;          new directories (i.e. packages) for you.
;;      o   The `load-path' is optimized so, that users' files automatically
;;          take precedence first (~/elisp), next any other files found,
;;          and last the core Emacs files in the distribution.
;;
;;     Automatic Info-default-directory-list configuration
;;
;;      o   If you download packages that include Emacs info files,
;;          the `Info-default-directory-list' is updated at the same time
;;          as the `load-path', when root directories are examined.
;;      o   No more manual updating of info files. The missing
;;          `dir' entry is created or updated as needed.
;;      o   You can update all _new_ info files in your system by calling
;;          M-x `tinypath-info-scan-Info-default-directory-list'
;;
;;      If new info filesare added by hand, call function
;;      `tinypath-info-handler' to update your Emacs and update the
;;      `dir' entry. After that reset old information with `M-x'
;;      `tinypath-info-initialize'.
;;
;;      This feature was designed to be used under Windows where
;;      Cygwin installation provided many manual pages, which would
;;      have been handy to read under Win32 Native Emacs. The catch
;;      was how to mix Cygwin + Native Emacs for manual page and info
;;      page reading. Under *nix this feature is of limited usability,
;;      because info pages are installed in orderly manner by the system
;;      installation scripts.
;;
;;     Win32 automatic manpath configuration
;;
;;      o   In Unix systems the MANPATH enavironment variable contains
;;          directories where to find manual pages, but in Win32,
;;          there is no default MANPATH and `M-x' `man' does not work.
;;      o   If package *woman.el* (Included in latest Emacs
;;          versions) is along `load-path', it is automatically
;;          configured to support to read manual pages. It replaces
;;          the `M-x' `man' command.
;;
;;     Win32 Cygwin environment support
;;
;;      o   If *cygwin1.dll* (<http://www.cygwin.com/>) is in `exec-path',
;;          automatic detection tries to find the Cygwin root and scan
;;          manual pages and info pages for use with *woman.el*
;;          _Note:_ This feature is for native Win32 Emacs. Nowadays,
;;          there is also native Cygwin Emacs, which behaves just like
;;          the big brother *nix Emacs.
;;
;;     Compressed lisp file support
;;
;;      o   Overloads commands load, load-library, load-file, require
;;          and autoload to accept `jka-compr' compressed lisp .el files.
;;      o   Primarily meant to be used in low quota accounts.
;;      o   Compress or decompress lisp files. You don't have to change
;;          a thing in your Emacs startup file, all will work as usual.
;;      o   Handle aliased commands that turn out to be
;;          in `autoload' state.
;;
;;  How to set up your load path
;;
;;      The `tinypath--load-hook' should contain function
;;      `tinypath-setup' which starts examining all directories under
;;      `load-path' and `tinypath--load-path-root' which is set to
;;      reasonable defaults of site wide and personal installations.
;;      If you keep all your lisp files under *$HOME/elisp*, then you
;;      do not need to configure anything for this package to work.
;;      Your `load-path' will be updated after this code at the
;;      beginning of your *$HOME/.emacs*
;;
;;          (load "~/elisp/tiny/tinypath") ;; Or anywhere you have it installed
;;
;;      If there are _many_ separate Emacs lisp root directories, like
;;      one for *site-lisp* and one for *site-packages* and one for
;;      *personal* *lisp* files, then those directories should be
;;      added to variable `tinypath--load-path-root'. Below there is
;;      an example for PC users, where the E: partition replicates
;;      identical Unix tree structure. We suppose for a moment that
;;      Cygwin is installed also there. The following actually works for
;;      shared Unix Emacs setup file too, because non-existing
;;      directories will get ignored:
;;
;;          (setq tinypath--load-path-root
;;            '("~/elisp"  "E:/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/common"))
;;          (load "~/elisp/tiny/tinypath")
;;
;;  Peiodic load path syncronization watchdog
;;
;;      If new lisp packages are installed and tried reularly when new
;;      development versions are tracked, then the manual need to call
;;      `M-x' `tinypath-cache-regenerate' may become tiresome. There
;;      is a built in idle timer watchdog included in the package, but
;;      it is not activated by default. Its job is to examine load path
;;      every now and them when Emacs is idle to see if the `load-path'
;;      has gone out of synch i.e. new paths have appeared, old ones removed
;;      or new packages has been added. This feature is experimental and
;;      the scanning may be quite resource intensive because bursts of disk I/O
;;      is needed to determine the status of the paths and files. To enable
;;      it, you must set the load hook before anything else:
;;
;;          (setq tinypath--load-hook
;;             '(tinypath-install tinypath-install-timer))
;;          ...
;;          (load "~/elisp/tiny/tinypath")
;;
;;  XEmacs and Emacs specific directories
;;
;;      In spite of great effort from developers to make packages
;;      compatible for both Emacs platforms, there is always some packages
;;      that only work with Emacs or XEmacs. It is assumed that the site
;;      admin has created directories like these to keep the *site-lisp*
;;      installation clean:
;;
;;          ;;   This might be also under /opt/share/site-lisp
;;          ;;   Refer to file hierarchy standard at
;;          ;;   http://www.pathname.com/fhs/
;;
;;          /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/common/   .. XEmacs and Emacs
;;          /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacs/    .. only for Emacs
;;          /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/xemacs/   .. only for XEmacs
;;
;;      To take care of the Emacs specific `load-path' setting, use code
;;      similar to the below. If you load the setup multiple times, the
;;      `pushnew' ensures that the directories are not added multiple
;;      times.
;;
;;          (require 'cl)
;;          (dolist (path ("~/elisp"
;;                         ;;  For both Emacs and XEmacs
;;                         "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/common"
;;                         ;;  Select Emacs or XEmacs specific installations
;;                         (if (boundp 'xemacs-logo)
;;                             "/usr/share/xemacs/site-lisp"
;;                           "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacs")))
;;            (when (stringp path)
;;              (pushnew path tinypath--load-path-root :test 'string=)))
;;
;;          ;; PLEASE COPY VERBATIM. THERE ARE OPTIMIZATIONS
;;          ;; THAT ACTIVATE IF YOU ADD THE PATH
;;          (pushnew "~/elisp/tiny/lisp" load-path :test 'string=)
;;          (load "tinypath.el")
;;
;;      The package will check current emacs version and make sure
;;      that only correct directories are included to the
;;      `load-path'. If you simply instructed to search the whole
;;      site-lisp root `/usr/share/site-lisp', and current emacs
;;      binary is "emacs", then all directories that contain path
;;      portion `/xemacs' would have been automatically ignored.
;;
;;     Building part of site-lisp from Internet
;;
;;      If we continue talking a bit more about site-lisp, there is utility
;;      *pwget.pl* at <http://freshmeat.net/projects/perlwebget/>. It
;;      includes an Emacs configuration settings which contain knowledge
;;      where the various lisp developers' home pages are and how to
;;      download lisp packages. If you have lot of disk space and you're
;;      interested in experimenting with more packages to go with your
;;      Emacs, follow the instruction laid out in the pwget's project page.
;;
;;      Now, the overall structure of whole site-lisp might look
;;      something like this:
;;
;;                   ROOT/  ( /usr/share/emacs or equivalent )
;;                   |

;;
;;     XEmacs 21.2+ core packages
;;
;;      Some XEmacs versions come with only the very basic installation.
;;      Lisp packages may be distributed in separate archive
;;      *xemacs-packages* (nick named "SUMO" due to its huge size). There is
;;      also *mule-packages* and *site-packages* archives. A built-in
;;      heuristics tries to guess the location of these by looking under
;;      and near your XEmacs installation. Here is example from Win32:
;;
;;          .../XEmacs/XEmacs-NN.N/xemacs-packages
;;          .../XEmacs/xemacs-packages
;;
;;      If the archives have been installed elsewhere, you have to tell the
;;      location by defining following variable prior loading TinyPath. You
;;      can't put these to `tinypath--load-path-root' because this is
;;      special information that needs to present during the very initial
;;      boot-up to find crucial packages like *jka-compr.el*.
;;
;;          (setq tinypath--core-emacs-load-path-list
;;                '("/usr/share/site-lisp/xemacs/xemacs-packages"
;;                  "/usr/share/site-lisp/xemacs/mule-packages"
;;                  "/usr/share/site-lisp/xemacs/site-packages"))
;;
;;  Finding load-path directories
;;
;;      Supposing only default *$HOME/elisp* is used directory for files, the
;;      `tinypath--load-path-function' starts recursively searching all
;;      the directories under the root(s) `tinypath--load-path-root'. Not all
;;      directories are counted in when the search descends below the root(s).
;;      Variable `tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp' decides if the directory
;;      should be ignored. By default:
;;
;;      o   Package's additional subdirectories like texinfo, tex, doc, etc,
;;          misc, RCS, CVS, .svn (Subversion), MT (monotone version control),
;;          .git, .hg, .darcs and 'zip' are ignored.
;;      o   Any temporary directories named .../t/ .../T/ .../tmp* .../temp*
;;          are ignored.
;;      o   Directories that do not contain any files ending to .el or .elc are
;;          ignored. (it's faster to do the above checks first).
;;
;;  Gnus and other 3rd party packages
;;
;;      _Note:_ In latest version of this utility *Gnus* is treated
;;      specially. All Gnus versions are detected along load-path and
;;      the very latest Gnus version is installed to your
;;      `load-path'. This is based on the knowledge in the
;;      `gnus-version' variable and the heuristics will pick the
;;      newest for you. You actually do not have to do anything else,
;;      but to drop latest Gnus somewhere, to be able to use it
;;      immediately.
;;
;;       Under the hood (old documentation)
;;
;;      It is important to understand how this package works: It caches
;;      every possible lisp directory it can find. Now, if you have
;;      installed private copy of Gnus, say in `~/elisp/cvs-packages/gnus',
;;      there is a problem, because Emacs distribution also includes Gnus.
;;      There is NO WAY TO TELL OR CHANGE path order when the cache is in
;;      use. This is a design decision and cannot be changed. The old trick,
;;      where a new directory was added in front of `load-path', will not
;;      work because everything goes through cache. What you need to do
;;      instead, is to tell that the "other" Gnus should be ignored during
;;      cache creation, so that it is completely unknown.
;;
;;     Solution: ignoring directories
;;
;;      There is very simple way. Put your regular expression to
;;      `tinypath--ignore-file-regexp-extra' and it will tell which
;;      directories to ignore. Define the ignore regexp before loading
;;      TinyPath:
;;
;;          (setq tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp-extra
;;                "\\|[/\\]x?emacs[/\\0-9.]+[/\\]lisp[/\\]gnus")
;;          ;; PLEASE COPY VERBATIM. THERE ARE OPTIMIZATIONS
;;          ;; THAT ACTIVATE If YOU ADD THE PATH
;;          (require 'cl)
;;          (pushnew "~/elisp/tiny/lisp" load-path :test 'string=)
;;          (load "tinypath.el")
;;
;;      [For advanced Lisp programmers] You can add ignored gnus directory
;;      to `tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp' via
;;      `tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp-hook'. When the hook is run, the
;;      default value for `tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp' is already
;;      available. In hook, append regular expression that excludes the
;;      Gnus directory. Here is an example; make sure that you don't add
;;      the regexp multiple times. The multiple invocations is protected by
;;      setting a plist property and checking it. The ugly [\\/] makes the
;;      regexp compatible with both Unix and win32 paths. System
;;      directories in Unix are typically /emacs/NN.NN/ and in win32
;;      /emacs-NN.NN/, that's why added "-".
;;
;;          (add-hook 'tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp-hook
;;                    'my-tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp-hook)
;;
;;          (defun my-tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp-hook ()
;;            ;;  Do this only once
;;            (unless (get 'my-tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp-hook 'set)
;;              ;; mark as done.
;;              (put 'my-tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp-hook 'set t)
;;              (setq tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp
;;                    (concat
;;                     tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp
;;                     "[/\\]x?emacs[/\\0-9.]+[/\\]lisp[/\\]gnus"))))
;;
;;      FIXME: What about XEmacs public/private Gnus installations?
;;
;;  Updating new lisp packages
;;
;;      Suppose you have installed a new version of a package:
;;
;;          ~/elisp/gnus/foo-0.74/
;;          ~/elisp/gnus/foo-0.95/    ;; NEW
;;
;;      Both these directories end up being added to the `load-path',
;;      but that is not preferable. It is the latest version that
;;      should be in the `load-path'. The solution is to move the old
;;      versions under some name that will be ignored by default. It
;;      is recommended that a backup of previous packages are renamed
;;      to start with a word "tmp-". All directories that start with
;;      prefix *tmp* are ignored.
;;
;;          % mv ~/elisp/gnus/foo-0.74/ ~/elisp/gnus/tmp-foo-0.74/
;;                                                   ====
;;
;;      However if you update package in a site-lisp directory, there
;;      may be a distant problem that somebody needs older version of
;;      the package. If you made the backup like above, that user
;;      cannot load the old package any more, because it doesn't show
;;      up in `load-path'
;;
;;      There is no easy answer to keep old packages. Admin could
;;      announce that: "new version has been installed in DIR, the old
;;      one is in TMP-OLD-DIR" and have users manually arrange their
;;      `load-path' if needed. Following lisp command would solve
;;      their setup. The statement below adds the old directory to the
;;      *beginning* of `load-path' and thus load commands would find the
;;      old version of the package first.
;;
;;          (load "~/elisp/tiny/tinypath")
;;          ;;  Add more directories.
;;          (pushnew "TMP-OLD-OLD-DIR" load-path :test 'string=)
;;          (tinypath-cache-regenerate)
;;
;;      Remember to mention to users that they need to update cache with
;;      `tinypath-cache-regenerate' (called with prefix argument) to see
;;      the changes.
;;
;;  Duplicate files in path
;;
;;      If you have accustomed to putting your path to specific order,
;;      you have to rethink the strategy. The philosophy behind this
;;      utility was that there SHOULD BE NOT NEED TO DO MANUAL WORK TO
;;      UPDATE PATHS. This means that the order of the paths must not
;;      be significant. Now, you may face a situation where library or
;;      package contains a file, which has already been installed.
;;      Take for example, *smtpmail.el*:
;;
;;          /usr/bin/emacs-20.4/lisp/mail/smtpmail.el
;;          /usr/share/site-lisp/common/packages/semi/flim-1.12.1/smtpmail.el
;;
;;      There is a problem if FLIM's *smtpmail.el* is not compatible with
;;      the one in Emacs. If it is, then there is no problem. Either one
;;      can be loaded, and the `load-path' order does not matter. But you
;;      don't know that before you get error "function smtpmail-xxxx not
;;      defined" and you start investigating with (locate-library
;;      "smtpmail") which package is actually active.
;;
;;      Please investigate your path with [C-u] `M-x'
;;      `tinypath-cache-problem-report' and see if you find duplicate
;;      entries. Check each one and possibly move the file to another
;;      name or remove older ones. E.g. in the above situation, the
;;      cure might be moving FLIM's *smtpmail.el* under name
;;      *flim-smtpmail.el* so that it doesn't get loaded with (require
;;      'smtpmail). The BEST IS TO CONTACT THE MAINTAINER(S) and tell
;;      them about conflicts. Here is a sample of one generated
;;      problem report:
;;
;;          imenu.el
;;            323 34073 1998-05-07 16:28:08 /usr/share/site-lisp/common/other/
;;            910 37169 1999-12-04 02:47:58 /usr/share/site-lisp/common/programming/java/jde/jde-2.1.6beta13/lisp/
;;            1350 38663 1999-11-28 01:14:38 /usr/bin/emacs/gnu-emacs/emacs-20.4.1/lisp/
;;          base64.el
;;            515  9943 1999-12-11 19:15:20 /usr/share/site-lisp/common/packages/gnus-5.8.2/lisp/
;;            807  9892 1999-11-15 00:00:12 /usr/share/site-lisp/common/packages/w3-4.0pre.46/lisp/
;;
;;      _Explanation:_ Previously *imenu* was installed as a separate
;;      package. Now latest Emacs ships with one, so it is best to delete
;;      the previous one `other/imenu.el.' Keep on eye on the leftmost
;;      scores: The lower, the more close it is to the beginning of cache
;;      when the directories were searched. The package with lowest score
;;      will get loaded. Another package, *base64.el* seems to be
;;      problematic too. But because Gnus path has lowest score, it will
;;      get loaded before w3's base64.el. This is good, because Gnus
;;      contains the latest version of *base64.el*. In the buffer
;;      `tinypath-report-mode' a mode is turned on where you can manipulate
;;      reported lines. Unnecessary files can be deleted with
;;      `Control-shift-mouse-1' or `C-c' `C-d'.
;;
;;  Symlinked directories are ignored
;;
;;      It has been the tradition to use symlinks a lot in POSIX
;;      environments to arrange easy access to versioned packages. Like how
;;      to ~/elisp/gnus/ no matter what version is currently installed.
;;
;;          ln -s ~/elisp/packages/gnus-N.NN  ~/elisp/packages/gnus
;;
;;      This package however *skips* those symlinks and records the
;;      absolute path name to the `load-path'. There are couple of
;;      points: a) it is more instructive to peek the `load-path' to
;;      actually see what versions have been installed to the Emacs b)
;;      The symlinks are error prone since there may be several
;;      symlinks that lead to same directory and c) symlinks may not
;;      work well in heterogenous environments where Win32 and Linux
;;      and Unix hosts are networked together. To migrate to this
;;      package you need to examine your symlinks and remove them.
;;
;;      If you have drawn a symlink to the the current directory from
;;      *SEPARATE* directory, then that directory will never be seen:
;;
;;          ln -s ~/other-dir/elisp/artist-1.1/ ~/elisp/packages/artist-1.1
;;
;;      To solve this, instead either _a)_ move the package physically
;;      under the ~/elisp/ from the *~/some-disk/elisp/* so that the
;;      recursive search will record it or _b)_ add the separate
;;      directory *~/other-dir/elisp* to the variable
;;      `tinypath--load-path-root'.
;;
;;  Using cache
;;
;;      Now when you're freed from update burden of the directories in your
;;      disk, you can concentrate on organizing the files under sensible
;;      directories. Here is an example how the organizing could go:
;;
;;          ~/elisp/users/kevinr/       Kevin Rodger's files
;;          ~/elisp/users/ilya/         Ilya Zakharevich's files
;;          ..
;;          ~/elisp/packages/bbdb-2.00.06/  Version-ed packages
;;          ~/elisp/packages/psgml-1.0.3/
;;          ~/elisp/packages/pcl-cvs-2.9.2/
;;          ~/elisp/packages/tiny-19990215/
;;          ...
;;          ~/elisp/other/              All single add-on packages
;;
;;      All these paths in `load-path' and you can imagine how slow a
;;      standard Emacs would become: it takes even more time to find some
;;      package xxx, when Emacs sees a call (require 'xxx), because Emacs
;;      must start looking into every single directory under `load-path'
;;      until it can determine if it can or cannot load the asked package.
;;      This utility will store all lisp files in cache, and it is
;;      activated by default. The variable `tinypath--cache-expiry-days'
;;      controls the interval when it is concluded that a new tree
;;      recursion is needed. If you install new packages during those
;;      non-expiry days, it is best to call `C-u' `M-x'
;;      `tinypath-cache-regenerate' to build up to date image of your files
;;      and `load-path' directories.
;;
;;        If you want one short advice: always call `tinypath-cache-regenerate'
;;        after any lisp file or directory update.
;;
;;  Cache file and different Emacs versions
;;
;;      It is important that each Emacs loads correct cache file. The cache
;;      file's name is derived from the emacs version and emacs type, which
;;      can be "xemacs", "win32-xemacs", "emacs" or "win32-emacs".
;;
;;            tinypath--cache-file-prefix
;;          + EMACS-TYPE
;;          + HOST
;;          + EMACS-VERSION
;;          + tinypath--cache-file-postfix
;;
;;      An example:
;;
;;          ~/elisp/config/emacs-config-tinypath-cache-win32-HOST-emacs-20.4.1.el.gz
;;          ==========================================                        ======
;;          prefix                                                            postfix
;;
;;     Unix hosts and NFS mounts
;;
;;      In POSIX environment, it is also common that several hosts are
;;      NFS mounted so that the home disk is available from every
;;      server. The programs could also be NFS mounted, but many times
;;      programs are stored locally on each server's own disks. Now,
;;      there would be a problem if you logged to host *A* and started
;;      tinypath.el which had made cache in host *B*, because *A* does
;;      not have the same directories as *B* did (site-lisp). This has
;;      been taken care of by including _hostname_ part in the cache
;;      file name. For each host, a separate cache file is
;;      created. Now, suppose all the Unix hosts are same brand, say
;;      Sun OS, Linux, or HP-UX and a good administrator has separated
;;      the programs and the data in their own directory
;;      structures. Furthermore, these directories are NFS mounted and
;;      thus visible to the remote machines. In this scenario, it
;;      would not really matter to which host you log into, because
;;      you would always see the same programs and site-lisp
;;      directories and there would not be need for host specific
;;      cache files. In that case, it is possible to disable the
;;      *HOST* word by setting with:
;;
;;          (setq tinypath--cache-file-hostname-function nil)
;;
;;  Info file support
;;
;;      In addition to updating the `load-path', the recursive function
;;      has a chance to search for installed info files as well. When you
;;      keep all your site lisp under one directory, it is not uncommon
;;      that the bigger packages include documentation files in info format
;;      as well. Like:
;;
;;          /usr/share/site-lisp/emacs/pcl-cvs-2.9.9/
;;          /usr/share/site-lisp/common/packages/psgml-1.2.1/
;;
;;      One possibility is that after you download and uncompress a
;;      package, you copy the info file to some central directory
;;      where you keep all you info files. This is lot of manual work.
;;      (Never mind that in Unix you might use Makefile to install
;;      everything, in Win32 it's all manual work). This package does the
;;      same job by looking for directories that either have info files or
;;      a central info repository called `dir'. If the `dir' file
;;      has all the info files up to date, nothing is done. In other cases:
;;
;;      o   If the central `dir' in the directory does not exits,
;;          it is created.
;;      o   If `dir' does not contain entry for info file, it is added.
;;          The entry name is derived from the filename.
;;
;;      The `Info-default-directory-list' is updated to include any new
;;      directory locations and they are saved to same cache file. When you
;;      call `C-h' `i' you will see the new info entries. Easy and
;;      maintenance friendly. No need to worry about supplied info files any
;;      more, they are automatically integrated to your Emacs. If you have
;;      installed any new packages to your system, Emacs packages or Unix
;;      packages that installed something with "install -c", it is best to
;;      update your info files with `M-x'
;;      `tinypath-info-scan-Info-default-directory-list'. This is also
;;      called if you call: `C-u' `M-x' `tinypath-cache-regenerate'
;;
;;  Cygwin support (Win32 and woman.el)
;;
;;      It is common that Emacs in Win32 environment is coupled with
;;      <http://www.cygwin.com> toolkit which contains all the manual pages
;;      for the unix commands and possibly new info pages. This package
;;      will locate `cygwin1.dll' file along PATH and recurse whole cygwin
;;      installation root to find new entries that can be used inside
;;      Emacs. In theory this all should happen automatically and the only
;;      thing you have to do is to ensure that you have proper PATH
;;      settings at your OS level before this package is started. If Cygwin
;;      /bin directory in in PATH, `tinypath--extra-path-root' will get set
;;      to a correct value at boot time.
;;
;;      If you have more places where you keep Unix tools which contain
;;      more manual or info pages, like Reed Kotler (old Unix-like env)
;;      http://www.reedkotler.com/ you _must_ manually set variable
;;      `tinypath--extra-path-root' to the list of search root directories.
;;      If you set this yourself, you _must_ also include the cygwin
;;      installation root directory
;;
;;          (setq tinypath--extra-path-root
;;                '("e:/unix-root/cygwin"
;;                  "e:/unix-root/reed-kotler"
;;                  ...))
;;
;;      Package *woman.el* will be configured automatically if it is along
;;      `load-path' to handle manual page viewing with command `M-x'
;;      `man'. Please make sure that you do not destroy the pre-defined
;;      `woman-manpath' in your Emacs startup files with lisp commands or
;;      the efforts to find out new manual pages are thrown off the window.
;;      Search you startup files for anything that looks like `setq',
;;      `defvar', `defconst': (setq woman-manpath ... and change the code
;;      to _add_ to the variable instead:
;;
;;          (require 'cl)
;;          (dolist (path '("one" "two" "three"))
;;            (pushnew (expand-file-name path) woman-manpath :test 'string))
;;
;;  Faster Emacs configuration (Perl emacs-util.pl)
;;
;;      Indication of this feature at startup is a message, where
;;      EXT refers to externally launched process. It must be waited
;;      until further processing is done; i.e. Emacs is hung for a while.
;;
;;          TinyPath: EXT Process running ... [may take a while]
;;
;;      As this package evolved and more support was added to various
;;      environments, like Cygwin, which required traversing hundred of
;;      directories to find out if they contained info or manual pages,
;;      it came evident that Emacs Lisp method was too slow. An alternative
;;      method was developed using Perl language and written in *emacs-util.pl*
;;      which can traverse directory hierarchies to find relevant
;;      directories for the setup. This interface is automatically used
;;      if two conditions are met in current environment:
;;
;;      o   Binary *perl* must be along PATH. (according  `executable-find')

;;      o   Intel 400MHz, IBM GXP 80G IDE/ATA 100 disk, whole Cygwin
;;          installation scan: 3 min 46 sec, dirs: 2373, files: 35 271
;;      o   Same PC, but this time site-lisp directory, subset of Cygwin
;;          hierarchy at /usr/share/site-lisp took:
;;          0 min 13 sec, dirs: 648, files: 8750
;;
;;      Let's consider one scenario that you may encounter if you intend to
;;      use Cygwin similarly as the big brother Linux. Let's suppose that
;;      you have dedicated a disk portion where you intend to duplicate
;;      whole Linux-like directory hierarchy. You have ROOT under which you
;;      keep all the files, including anything that is Cygwin-related.
;;
;;          E:/usr/share/site-lisp Emacs lisp as outlined earlier
;;          E:/usr/share/site-perl Perl packages and scripts
;;          E:/usr/share/site-php  PHP code
;;          E:/usr/share/site-cvs  Various other external CVS C-packages
;;
;;      The default heuristics `tinypath-ti::win32-cygwin-p' should find
;;      *cygwin1.dll* installed and report that Cygwin root is *E:/*
;;      This means that `tinypath--extra-path-root' will get set for
;;      you when package loads. Suppose further that you have set
;;      variable `tinypath--load-path-root' to point out suitable
;;      locations in *E:/usr/share/site-lisp*. It would seem
;;      that this combination means that the hierarchies would be
;;      traversed multiple times, since the Cygwin root already
;;      includes all the rest:
;;
;;          E:/                             Cygwin root
;;          E:/usr/share/site-lisp/emacs    For this emacs...
;;          E:/usr/share/site-lisp/common   Emacs and XEmacs compatible tree
;;
;;      Don't worry. The Perl utility is smart enough to reduce this
;;      to search only *E:/* and discard other roots as redundant. Hm,
;;      what if other lisp files are found _outside_ of the
;;      *E:/usr/share/site-lisp/*, because it searches every dir
;;      starting from *E:/* Say:
;;
;;          E:/tmp/try/some-file.el
;;
;;      Will the directory *E:/tmp/try/* reported as lisp `load-path'
;;      candidate and added to search list? Yes and no. Yes, it will be
;;      reported, but no, it will not be added to the `load-path' because it
;;      doesn't match the initial user's idea where to look for lisp files. If
;;      you pump up the `tinypath--verbose' to level 5, you can see PATH-NOK
;;      messages labeled "candidate" to indicate those rejections. Only files
;;      that reside under `tinypath--load-path-root' directories are counted
;;      in.
;;
;;  Updating running Emacs
;;
;;      Suppose you have downloaded the latest versions of packages X, Y and Z
;;      and you want your current Emacs's paths updated, call this function:
;;
;;          M-x tinypath-cache-regenerate
;;
;;      Take a bit of skepticism: It is a fortunate event if it all
;;      worked that easily. You see, you already have several packages
;;      loaded in your Emacs and they are using the "old" code. Now
;;      you wiped the old directories away and told Emacs to look for
;;      only "new" directories.  After a while you may run into
;;      bizarre dependency problems. I recommend that after any major
;;      package update, which contains _several_ of files (like Gnus),
;;      you:
;;
;;      o    Install package and regenerate cache in current Emacs session
;;           with `M-x' `tinypach-cache-regenerate'.
;;      o    Save your current Emacs buffers (see *desktop.el*, *tinydesk.el*)
;;      o    Quit, restart Emacs and restore your working desktop.
;;
;;  Compressed lisp file support
;;
;;      In order to use the full compression support for autoload
;;      functions as well, set variable
;;      `tinypath--compression-support' to symbol `all'. The normal
;;      value for compression is 'default which support handling
;;      `require' and `load' commands. The variable must be set before
;;      package is loaded.
;;
;;     About Jka-compr package
;;
;;      jka-compr.el has native support to un/compress any file that
;;      have specific extensions. The handling is done via
;;      `file-name-handler-alist' and commands like these will load
;;      properly including any autoloads.
;;
;;          (load "my-el.gz")
;;
;;      The problem is that the load statements have to be manually
;;      changed so that they end in .gz so that jka-compr takes care
;;      of loading. What if the file is later uncompressed? Again all
;;      the load commands must be updated. This isn't very nice, since
;;      it should be able to un/compress elisp files and still have
;;      permanent load statements. Basically this is what the
;;      compression support here is all about; there is no need to
;;      worry if the file is compressed or not when advised functions
;;      are in effect. The following statement will work for both file
;;      types:
;;
;;          (load "my-el")
;;
;;     How the compressed loading works
;;
;;      o   When user request `load' FILE, try to find some compressed file
;;          that JKA knows about by adding extensions ".gz" and ".Z" and
;;          whatever user has configured JKA to handle. _LIMITATION:_
;;          only .gz .bz2 and the like that compress one file at a time
;;          is currently supported. Don't try using .zip or similar.
;;      o   If the FILE is absolute path, then look from that
;;          directory only.
;;      o   If no directory is given, find the file along the `load-path'.
;;      o   If there was somewhere a compressed file, just load it (because JKA
;;          will transparently uncompress it), eval it, and kill the buffer.
;;      o   If NO COMPRESSED file was found, just follow normal
;;          emacs rules.
;;
;;     Note: Why you should not prefer compressed .elc files
;;
;;      The purpose of compression support is to make it possible to
;;      have more useful lisp files in an account that has a limited
;;      disk space (quota). Many Unicersity student accounts have this
;;      limitation. Keeping lisp files in compressed format
;;      saves quite a much disk space.
;;
;;      o   Plain text, lisp `.el', files compress better.
;;      o   The documentation in comments is important, e.g all the
;;          instruction to use the file are there. Byte compiling
;;          strips away documentation.
;;      o   In order to debug or send bug reports you need .el files.
;;          The errors from .elc files are useless.
;;      o   The performance ratio that the .elc files offer may not
;;          be a crucial factor (many times you couldn't tell).
;;
;;     Note: advised emacs commands
;;
;;      The adviced functions can be further adviced, but
;;      if the redefined function uses `interactive-p' test, it will
;;      not indicate user call (like M-x load-library). The reason why
;;      the advised functions detect it, is that advice.el's
;;      `ad-do-it' macro cannot pass the interactive flag information
;;      to the original functions.
;;
;;  Trouble shooting
;;
;;      There is no denying it, this package is potentionally
;;      dangerous. When something goes wrong, it really goes wrong and
;;      your Emacs may be messed up completely. So, here are some
;;      trouble shooting tips, that you might want to try to rescue
;;      the situation or understand what is going on. The most usual
;;      blame is the *cache* content which does not contain the
;;      correct or up to date information.
;;
;;     Package is not found or loaded?
;;
;;      Please confirm that the file location is known and is in right
;;      directory by calling `M-x' `locate-library'. If the result is
;;      not correct, please check `tinypath--load-path-root' and
;;      `tinypath--extra-path-root'. Try to remedy the situation,
;;      regenerate cache with `C-u' `M-x' `tinypath-cache-regenerate'.
;;
;;     You don't know what particular package is causing troubles
;;
;;      Go to the *Message* buffer and clear it (`C-x' `h' followed by
;;      `C-w'). Run the path generation engine with debug `M-x'
;;      `tinypath-debug-external-helper' and study the output. It may
;;      be ignoring some files that you think should be included. Please
;;      check content of `tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp' and
;;      `tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp-extra'.
;;
;;     You need to see the internals
;;
;;      Call function `tinypath-cache-file-find-file' to display the current
;;      cache and use `C-s' and `C-r' to search entries in the file. Remember
;;      that you must not modify this file, because any changes you do, will
;;      get overwritten next time the cache is regenerated. The problem is
;;      somewhere else if you can see incorrect items in the cache file.
;;
;;  Code note: General
;;
;;      Because this package is among the first that is loaded from Emacs
;;      startup file, It contains copies of some functions from TinyLib
;;      libraries, to make the package independent until the point where
;;      the `load-path' has been set up and other libraries are available.
;;      In the code you may find marks "#copy:" which indicate code that
;;      has been copied/simplified to be used here. Autoload statements in
;;      this package defer loading functions until the end is reached and
;;      `load-path' is determined and the rest of the functions can be
;;      loaded from the libraries.
;;
;;  Code note: Where is that emacs package
;;
;;      If you ever need to know the location of a package that Emacs
;;      would load or has loaded, while this utility is in effect,
;;      use this call:
;;
;;          (insert (tinypath-cache-p "gnus.el"))
;;
;;      In fact the regular call yields same result, because
;;      `locate-library' is adviced:
;;
;;          (insert (locate-library "gnus.el"))
;;
;;      More easily, with *tinylisp.el*, which takes advantage of
;;      tinypath.el cache, you can load any emacs package for editing
;;      with command:
;;
;;          M-x load-library RET tinylisp RET
;;          M-x tinylisp-library-find-file
;;          (tinypath cache)Lisp Library: gnus.el RET
;;
;;      Alternatively there is mode hot-keys $ l f  and  $ l p :
;;
;;          M-x load-library RET tinylisp RET
;;          M-x tinylisp-install
;;          M-x tinylisp-mode  (in *scratch* buffer, see "E" in modeline)
;;          $ l f
;;          (tinypath cache)Lisp Library: gnus.el RET
;;
;;  Code note: Internal optimizations
;;
;;      In the installation section it is instructed that the location of the
;;      package is pushed into the `load-path' before the package is loaded:
;;
;;          (require 'cl)
;;          (pushnew "~/elisp/tiny/lisp/tiny" load-path :test 'string=)
;;          (load "tinypath.el")
;;
;;      Please follow this instruction. The reason is that program
;;      tries to use most efficient code to boot everything up and the
;;      first thing it does is to check the location where it has been
;;      saved. This package will use this information to assume that
;;      the Perl program is available somewhere near that that path
;;      (../../bin). If that fails, the Perl program is searched along
;;      `exec-path'. This is usually desirable, situation because
;;      every new installation includes newer version of Perl program
;;      and the one at `exec-path' may not be up to date. The perl
;;      code will speed up booting compared to pure Emacs Lisp
;;      implementation. In addition the Perl code section in this file
;;      (often referred as "external") has extra features included.
;;
;;  Code note: *Messages*
;;
;;      This package will print loads of messages to Emacs "*Message*" or
;;      XEmacs " *Message-Log*" buffer. This is a design decisions so that
;;      execution can be easily traced during Emacs load time. It also help
;;      reporting errors. The default `tinypath--verbose' 3 will log the most
;;      important messages.  Even if you set the level to 0 or nil, still
;;      some messages are displayed. Have a look at Message buffer if you have
;;      not much used it before. You may find interesting information to
;;      debug some of your own mis-configurations, like stale directories
;;      in `exec-path'.
;;
;;  Code note: Insinuating packages
;;
;;      Some packages can be auto-configured when the perl script
;;      reads the contents of the directories. Like package *woman.el*
;;      which needs to know the location of man path directories. For
;;      other packages there are different "installations". Gnus is
;;      one interesting example: Every Emacs and XEmacs release comes
;;      with Gnus version, which is usually outdated and many install
;;      Gnus privately. Multiple Gnus versions in the load paths is a
;;      problem and the wished situation is that there would be only
;;      the latest. Program's logic tries to find out which of the
;;      Gnus packages along `load-path' is the latest and hopefully
;;      after making the right decision (according to gnus-version-*
;;      variable) the other Gnus locations are hidden by modifying
;;      `load-path' and `tinypath--load-path-ignore-regexp'. This is a
;;      complimentary method to that suggested in this manual section's
;;      topic "3rd party packages".
;;
;;  Code note: Elp profiling results
;;
;;      The profiling results were run using method below. It must be note,
;;      that the `tinypath-external-*' is the time when the external perl
;;      program examines all the directories, so EXT time is not significant
;;      because it varies from system to system. The
;;      `tinypath-external-setup-parse-data' is the actual time spent in
;;      parsing the returned data. The functions that are called most of the
;;      time are the ones that must be kept on eye on and they seem to
;;      perform very well. Immediate below are the most important functions
;;      that perform the Parsing after the perl has returned results (these
;;      are not from the total listing, but after tweaking). The listing

** TinyPath.el: [INFO] environment variable %s set to `%s'

   In this Windows ME/NT/2000 there was variable USERNAME which was copied

   not affect outside environment, so you're adviced to define these
   variables permanetly through Start=> Control-Panel=>
   SystemIcon/Environment tab/

   If you want to set this locally to your Emacs, add following code
   to your startup file at $HOME/.emacs

      ;; \"username\" must contain no spaces. Max 8 characters
      (setenv \"USER\"  \"username\")

   In Windows Win95/98/NT: Add this statement to your c:\\AUTOEXEC.BAT file

      set USER=johndoe
      set LOGNAME=johndoe

   The `johndoe' is a short, usually maximum of 8 characters, which must
   not contain spaces. The value usually is the same as the HOME path's
   last directory name.

If you have Mounted Unix disk (say H: ) which sees your Unix $HOME directory,
then keep in mind that NT Emacs does not see symlinked directories.

Call this function from _Unix_ Emacs and it converts symbolic links to
real directory names and writes output to FILE.

You can then load that file in your NT emacs and make it see all
the same directories as your Unix Emacs does.

Repeat this every time you make symbolic path links in Unix.
