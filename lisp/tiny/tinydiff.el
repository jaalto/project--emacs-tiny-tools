;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, Jan 1996
;;
;;      Long ago there was set of simple functions lying around to
;;      generate instant diffs for the file that was being edited,
;;      before it was checked in with version control tools. At the
;;      time *vc.el* was not in the Emacs distribution. Examining
;;      diffs and using "goto-line" command in other buffer gave an
;;      idea to make a separate diff mode. The project turned out to
;;      be a bit bigger than just taking simple diff. You may wonder,
;;      why would you use this utility over ediff.el? If you like
;;      working with "command line" diff interface, then you may want
;;      to use this utility over *ediff.el*. There is a command prompt
;;      when various diff options can be manipulated with key
;;      bindings.
;;
;;  Overview of features
;;
;;      Taking diff
;;
;;      o   Buffer based simple diff/rcsdiff/patch package.
;;      o   You can diff current buffer against last saved backup copy.
;;      o   Give and manipulate diff command in echo-area: file name
;;          completion; switching between rcsdiff/diff, guess rcs version
;;          for buffer, various diff switches...
;;
;;      Browsing diff
;;
;;      o   Supported: normal diff, context diff, gnu diff -u, gnu diff -n
;;      o   When you have diff output in buffer, turning on `tinydiff-mode'
;;          allows you to browse source buffer by jumping diff blocks fwd/back
;;          and showing the source location.
;;      o   You can kill single diff block with `tinydiff-block-kill'
;;      o   You can apply only the current diff block (patch) with
;;          `tinydiff-block-apply-patch'
;;
;;      Sending or saving diff
;;
;;      o   In diff buffer, you can save the diff to a file with "W"; write
;;      o   In diff buffer, you can attach the content as MIME diff to
;;          the open mail buffer. Or if you don't have MIME-edit active,
;;          the diff is added without MIME tags. Command "M" for Mime.
;;
;;      Patch
;;
;;      o   Easy patching. Finds file to patch (along user defined paths)
;;          and applies the diff. You can receive patches by email
;;          and apply them with one or two keystrokes.
;;      o   Finds the file to patch through pre defined paths.
;;      o   Can also patch compresses .gz file.
;;      o   loads patch rejection file, if patch didn't succeed 100%
;;      o   Re-evaluates patched lisp file if the file was used by Emacs
;;      o   If you don't want to apply whole diff, use
;;          `tinydiff-block-apply-patch' for individual sections.
;;
;;  Genrating diff -- parsing diff
;;
;;      Be in buffer where you have diff file and just turn on the
;;
;;          M-x tinydiff-mode
;;
;;      Then take a look at the bindings you have available:
;;
;;          C-x b
;;
;;      If you want to generate diff against current buffer and file on
;;      disk, call function
;;
;;          M-x tinydiff-diff-show
;;
;;      In windowed system an those Emacs versions that have
;;      highlighting capabitities can enjoy more about this mode,
;;      because it marks line numbers in buffer with `mouse-face'. You
;;      can just click the point to jump to diff position.
;;
;;  Taking diffs
;;
;;      The main purpose of this package is to help taking "diff
;;      shots". This means that the file must be loaded into emacs and
;;      the cursor must be in the buffers, before you execute
;;
;;          M-x tinydiff-diff-show
;;
;;      o   if the file is not version controlled, a regular diff is offered
;;      o   if file is version controlled, your're offered vc prompt
;;      o   if the buffer has changed, you're offered to diff against
;;          last saved file to see recent changes you have done since you
;;          saved the buffer.
;;
;;  Command prompt
;;
;;      The help key is on `?', press it to get summary of command while
;;      you're in minibuffer prompt. The command prompt in minibuffer looks
;;      like this for RCS version controlled file.
;;
;;          > cd /users/foo/dir1/dir2; rcsdiff -c -r1.21 test.txt
;;
;;      You can edit this command as much as you like, but please leave `cd'
;;      `XXX' alone because the minibuffer commands expect it it be
;;      present. The hotkey command won't work without it.
;;
;;  Command prompt: rcsdiff and diff toggle
;;
;;      To conveniently construct diff command against another file, say
;;      test2.txt, you can hit key `C-z' to chage the prompt immediately to
;;
;;          > cd /users/foo/dir1/dir2; diff -c test.txt
;;
;;      And add the `test2.txt' to the end of line. If you want to restore
;;      the previous rcsdiff form, just hit `C-z' again. This `C-z'
;;      facility works only if the initial command was rcsdiff. There is no
;;      point of converting initial diff command to rcsdiff command though.
;;
;;  Command prompt: tab completes file name
;;
;;      While your're editing the command you can also use the TAB key to
;;      complete filename in the 'cd' command directory. If you specify any
;;      directories for the file, the directory's files are completed.
;;      That feature should allow you to get filenames into the prompt
;;      easily.
;;
;;  Command prompt: diffing between two RCS revisions
;;
;;      There is also more commands, like `C-r' which changes
;;
;;          > cd /users/foo/dir1/dir2; rcsdiff -c -r1.21 test.txt
;;
;;      prompt so that it has now two -r commands. You can take diffs
;;      between two versions easily with it. The `C-r' key is a toggle.
;;
;;          > cd /users/foo/dir1/dir2; rcsdiff -c -r1.21 -r1.21 test.txt
;;
;;       Case study:
;;
;;      You see a package on the net. You download it and notice that
;;      it needs some fixes. You put the original version to your
;;      private rcstree with the same version number as what the
;;      package had; say 2.2. Then you CheckOut the original, make
;;      changes, and put it back to tree with version 2.2.1.1. You
;;      dont't put it back with 2.3, because that's not your file. You
;;      made the correction to 2.2, so you must make a branch.
;;
;;      Okay. You have the original 2.2 and you have the fixed version
;;      2.2.1.1 and you want to send the diff to the author. Here is how
;;      you do it
;;
;;      o   Be on the file buffer 2.2.1.1 and call `M-x' `tinydiff-dif'
;;      o   Hit `C-r' toggle second revision (previous) and edit the line
;;          to look "-r2.2 -r2.2.1.1". You are usually comparing _old_ and
;;          new_ versions.
;;      o   Hit `C-s' to toggle between `-u' or `-c'. You normally want
;;          to send `-u' gnu unified diff, because it is more readable.
;;          Provided that the receiver has gnu patch to understand it.
;;      o   Hit `C-f' to add option `tinydiff--cl-user-option' which by
;;          default is `-kk'. From the rcsdiff(1) man pages you will
;;          see that it roughly means: "When you take diff between versions,
;;          ignore the rcs tag differencies". Confused? It means that
;;          the keywords that changed, like version, author, log ..
;;          when you deposited 2.2 and 2.2.1.1 are ignored.
;;
;;      And hit enter. Then you get clean diff that you can send to author.
;;      And when he responds back or sends you new version, say 2.5,
;;      you repeat the whole process again if you intend to make more
;;      changes put original 2.5 on ice and make branch 2.5.1.1 for your
;;      changes)
;;
;;  Command prompt: autosave and backup file diff
;;
;;      Other helpful commands insert he #autosaved# and backup~ filenames
;;      into the current point. Remember to put the # or ~ file to the left
;;      and not to the right. you do want to diff current file against the
;;      saved one; right? The first one is original prompt. That second is
;;      after `C-r' and latter after `C-v'
;;
;;          > cd /users/foo/dir1/dir2; diff -c test.txt
;;                                            * point here
;;
;;          > cd /users/foo/dir1/dir2; diff -c #test.txt# test.txt
;;          > cd /users/foo/dir1/dir2; diff -c ~/backup/test.txt~ test.txt
;;
;;      Notice that your backup file may not reside int he same directory.
;;      The backupfilename is returned by function `make-backup-file'.
;;
;;  Generated diff: the Prereq tag
;;
;;      It is important that when you send diff, it is diff between two
;;      rcs versions if possible (if you're author of program). In those
;;      cases where revision information can be found, the diff data
;;      is preceeded with this line:
;;
;;          Prereq: N.NN        e.g. Prereq: 1.76
;;
;;      If the receiving end has GNU patch, the patch program first checks
;;      if the version that person has is exactly N.NN and aborts if
;;      he had some other version. This prevent applying diffs that
;;      are meant to other versions. Regular Unix *patch* program
;;      does not read the *Prereq:* tag.
;;
;;  Patching
;;
;;      There is also included little patching function.
;;
;;          M-x tinydiff-patch          non verbose
;;          C-u M-x tinydiff-patch      verbose
;;
;;      For elisp (.el) files the `load-path' is automatically searched
;;      for possible destination of the patch. You can set variable
;;
;;          tinydiff--patch-list
;;
;;      To match files and their associated patch directories if you
;;      receive patches for other files regularly. This function is most
;;      useful for RCS diffs, because they can be easily detected and the
;;      file information is also included in the diff.
;;
;;  Patch: general notes
;;
;;      Note: normally when `patch' program is called it always makes
;;      backup with the suffix .orig. So if you have applied a patch,
;;      then there is two file in the directory.
;;
;;          FILE.txt        -- patched file
;;          FILE.txt.orig   -- original file, before the patch
;;
;;      It also creates rejections file if all dind't go as planned.
;;
;;          FILE.txt.rej
;;
;;  Patch: success or failure
;;
;;      When the patch has been applied, This package checks if all went
;;      well. If rejection file was created; then the patch process's
;;      output is shown and the rejection file is loaded so that you can
;;      see what possibly went wrong and if you should be concerned.
;;
;;      If you get this rejection file, then there propably is potential
;;      trouble. Please contact the sender of patch immediately and tell
;;      about your troubles. There are few common reasons why patch failure
;;      happened.
;;
;;      o   Sender forgot `-kk' switch when he run rcsdiff to the file
;;          that was not owned by him (See RCS for details about `-kk')
;;      o   Too few context, Sender should try increasing context with
;;          `-C' switch (like `-C7')
;;      o   The patch were modified during email transit. Ask
;;          to send the patch with some encoded format: uuencode, base64,
;;          PGP encrypted or PGP base64 signed (clearsig off) format.
;;
;;  Patch: what happens after success
;;
;;      When the patch succeeds, there is a bit special handling for Emacs
;;      elisp packages. Say we recieve correction to the following module
;;      and you have it loaded in emacs: (feature 'foo) returns true.
;;
;;          foo.el
;;
;;      After patch is applied, you're asked if you want to reload the
;;      new release of *foo* module (just patched). You should answer
;;      `Yes' to get the newest one running in your Emacs immediately.
;;
;;  Patch: after success, returning to original version
;;
;;      If the patched version, which is usually new version of the progrmam
;;      doesn't work as it is supposed to, you can go back to the original
;;      version by appluing the same patch again. You should report what
;;      problems you had to the maintainer and inform that you wnet back
;;      to previous version.
;;
;;      *IMPORTANT* If you did get the rejection file, you can't use that
;;      patch to go back to original!! See next chapter how to go to
;;      original version in that case
;;
;;  Patch: rejection file created -- what to do?
;;
;;      If you want to go back to original version, apply the same diff
;;      again; this reverses just applied patch. Just call `M-x'
;;      `tinydiff-patch' in the buffer where you have the diff.
;;
;;      When you do that, the function detects that there is already a
;;      .orig file and prompts you to choose an appropriate action.
;;      Here is the explanation what they do and what should you choose
;;
;;       Command _o_
;;
;;      Go back to (o)riginal. This copies the FILE.txt.orig over the
;;      FILE.txt and deletes FILE.txt.orig and doesn't do _anything_
;;      else (stops the patching process). You're back to starting
;;      point as if you never patched anything.
;;
;;       Command _r_
;;
;;      (R)etry means that the FILE.txt.orig is copied over FILE.txt and the
;;      pach is tried again for FILE.txt. You may have asked the author to
;;      send more context with using the -C10 switch and after you received
;;      this new patch you want to try if it now goes ok. The FILE.txt.orig
;;      still remains as a backup
;;
;;       Command _g_
;;
;;      (G)o says that we should apply the diff again to FILE.txt. Do this
;;      only if you did not get rejections last time. The intention
;;      is that you apply the patch again, and this reverses the situation.
;;      I mean 1) you patch; you get new version 2) you patch again: you
;;      degrade to the version before patch (original file before patch)
;;
;;  Development note
;;
;;      There is `ediff.el', which is much more complete package than
;;      this is. The aim was to develop a simple but handy package for
;;      everyday diff'ing and easy package patching.
;;
;;  Bugs
;;
;;      The "f" key, which shows the function identifier in diff browse
;;      mode `tinydiff-mode', can handle buffers which are narrowed, but if the
;;      buffer is using folding.el or similar package where goto-line does
;;      not work properly, the returned message shown to user is not
;;      correct.
;;
;;      Please unfold the buffer and you get the correct result.
;;
;;  Example
;;
;;      This hook setup turns on the view mode for easy scrolling
;;      of buffer.
;;
;;          (add-hook 'tinydiff--diff-hook  'my-tinydiff-diff-hook)
;;
;;          (defun my-tinydiff-diff-hook ()
;;            "Turn on view-mode in diff buffer."
;;            ;; See tinydiff--diff-buffer.
;;            (view-mode 1))
;;
;;  Sending good bug reports
;;
;;      If you find anything funny happening in the command line prompt
;;      while you use the tdi minibuffer commands. Immediately do
;;      following.
;;
;;      o   Turn on debug: `M-x' `tinydiff-debug-toggle'
;;      o   Turn on emacs debug: (setq debug-on-error t)
;;      o   Clear the debug buffer *tinydiff-debug* if it exists
;;      o   Start from original situation
;;      o   Do what you did and when the weird condition is met
;;          immediately go to *tinydiff-debug* buffer and save the
;;          content and send it to the maintainer.
