;;; Commentary:

;; Overview of features
;;
;;      o   Locks emacs completely until right key is entered.
;;      o   Auto-locks emacs after NN minutes idle time
;;      o   False login attemps are stored in history log.
;;      o   Blanks display or displays message buffer when locked.
;;      o   Hooks: before and after lock is activated and removed
;;
;;  About locking procedure
;;
;;      Don't get shocked now... When the lock gets in effect there must be
;;      no running processes inside emacs that would generate error and
;;      make emacs vulnerable to break in.  That's why all the running
;;      processes are killed before the lock takes in effect. If you have
;;      some valuable processes that are constantly running, you must make
;;      a separate "process control" function that would restart any such
;;      processes. Use the appropriate hook to activate those processes
;;      again after the emacs is unlocked. Use hooks
;;
;;          tinylock--before-lock-hook       ;; Save processes here
;;          tinylock--after-lock-hook        ;; restore processes here
;;
;;      and following function which tells you what processes are running.
;;
;;          M-x list-processes
;;
;;      All extra frames are also deleted. At least for now, because I
;;      don't know a reasonable way to save the frame configurations
;;      right now. Please send me piece of code or pointer to package
;;      that can save and restore frames and the windows back to previous
;;      state if you know good solution.
;;
;;  About auto locking feature, Emacs prior 19.34
;;
;;      When you load this package the `tinylock--load-hook' runs
;;      `tinylock-install-lock-timer' command that setup up a timer process that
;;      wakes up periodically. If the emacs has not changed compared to
;;      last saved emacs state, then the auto locking takes in effect
;;      immediately.
;;
;;      In old Emacs the activity is determined in simple way
;;
;;      o   if buffer list order has changed user is doing something.
;;      o   if `switch-buffer' was used, user is doing something
;;      o   if any buffer's size has changed, user is doing something.
;;
;;      This checking may not be enough: if user just scroll some
;;      text in buffer for NN minutes, then from `tinylock-process' 's point of
;;      view there has not been any activity and the user may suddenly
;;      notice that emacs locks up. Doing nothing but viewing one buffer
;;      all the time is fortunately rare.
;;
;;  About auto locking feature in new Emacs
;;
;;      New Emacs releases have command `run-with-idle-timer' which we use
;;      if it is available. When there has been no activity for NN minutes,
;;      your Emacs locks up.
;;
;;      The advice code and the other tricks we needed to detect idle
;;      activity in lower emacs versions aren't installed in these Emacs
;;      versions, so you don't have to worry about sudden lock.
;;
;;  Auto lock password
;;
;;      Do not put password in your ~/.emacs, but answer to the question
;;      which is asked when this file is loaded. If you want to change it
;;      during your emacs session, call function
;;
;;          M-x tinylock-auto-lock-set-password
;;
;;  Changing the auto lock interval
;;
;;      The auto lock interval depends on the wake up time of timer
;;      process. The default time is 20 minutes when you load this
;;      file. You can change the time by calling
;;
;;          M-x tinylock-auto-lock-set-interval
;;
;;      Or by putting this code in your ~/.emacs
;;
;;          ;; First define the hook, so that we can append to it
;;          (setq tinylock--load-hook
;;             '(tinylock-timer-control tinylock-auto-lock-set-password)
;;
;;          ;; add function to the end
;;          (add-hook 'tinylock--load-hook 'my-tinylock-auto-lock-set-interval 'append)
;;
;;
;;          (defun my-tinylock-auto-lock-set-interval ()
;;            "Change interval to 10 minutes."
;;            (tinylock-auto-lock-set-interval 10))
