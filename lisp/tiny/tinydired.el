;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, Jan 1996
;;

;;      This package started evolving, when there was need for something
;;      more from ange-ftp, like background file loading. Ange-ftp also had
;;      nasty habbit of putting user to just downloaded .zip or .tar.gz
;;      buffer. That not what was usually wanted, but to download the files
;;      somewhere other than inside emacs. There was need for ability to
;;      *mark* files for download and get them all at once to a download
;;      directory. With standard `ange-ftp' you would have to load them one
;;      by one. Sometimes you may want to go associated `ange-ftp' buffer
;;      and give commands directly there, so a command to switch between
;;      ange-ftp and dired buffers would be handy.
;;
;;      Now you can do this with standard `ange-ftp' and Emacs dired.
;;
;;      Note: This paskage is just extension to `ange-ftp', consider
;;      getting next generation ange-ftp, the `EFS', if you want
;;      overall better and more complete interface. Use this package if
;;      you only need features like batch put/get at backround.
;;      (Further note: EFS was later installed to XEmacs and it does not work
;;      any more with Emacs.)
;;
;;  Overview of features
;;
;;      o   Few enchancements to dired mode. Eg. keep only one
;;          dired buffer when ascending to directory. Shorten symlinks.
;;      o   User can mark and put files into STORE and start a backgroud
;;          ange-ftp session to get STORED files into download directory
;;      o   Easy switching between ange-ftp session buffer and dired buffer
;;      o   Dealing with ange ftp buffers in general
;;          (x)  killing all ange buffers at once
;;          (x)  killing all ange + dired ange buffers at once.
;;          (x)  switching to ange buffers with completion
;;      o   Run "!" on ange ftp dired buffer (operate on local copy)
;;      o   customizable backup file flagging.
;;      o   other handy dired commands, like "pop to this file in emacs."
;;          "find all marked files"...
;;
;;  XEmacs note
;;
;;      The dired and ange-ftp implementation (nowadays efs) is
;;      completely differen than in Emacs
;;
;;      ** THIS PACKAGE IS FOR Emacs ONLY **
;;
;;  General dired additions
;;
;;      In simplest form. This module installs some functions in your
;;      dired hooks. Their purpose is
;;
;;      o   To keep your dired buffer sorted so that directories are
;;          always put first.
;;      o   Delete unwanted files from dired buffer automatically.
;;      o   Shorten the symlink references, so that they don't spread
;;          multiple lines and ruin your view.
;;
;;      It also changes one dired function with `defadvice', so that you
;;      can control if you want to have only one dired buffer when
;;      ascending to another directory. See variable:
;;
;;          tinydired--use-only-one-buffer-flag
;;
;;  Dired and ange-ftp additions
;;
;;      When you want to start ftp session in emacs you just do
;;
;;          C-x C-f /login@site:/dir/dir/file
;;
;;      Let's take an example: To see what new things has arrived
;;      to GNU site, you'd do this:
;;
;;          C-x C-f /ftp@prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/
;;
;;      After that you are put into the dired listing, where you
;;      can mark files with dired-mark command
;;
;;          m           Mark file
;;
;;      Now you have files ready. Next put files into batch STORAGE.
;;      There is "a" prefix for ange-ftp related commands.
;;
;;          a S         Big S put selected files into storage
;;          a q         To check what files you have batched
;;          a c         To clear the batch storage
;;
;;      Now start ftp'ding the files in background. You're prompted
;;      for the download directory.
;;
;;          a g         Get marked file(s)
;;
;;      If you want to operate on the associated ftp buffer
;;      directly, there is command
;;
;;          a b         For "buffer change"
;;
;;      that puts you into ftp, where the dired buffer refers. When
;;      you're in the ftp buffer you have some keybinding available.
;;
;;          C-c f       insert stored files on the line
;;          C-c d       insert directory name
;;          C-c b       back to dired window
;;
;;      It's sometimes handy that you can give direct ftp commands.
;;
;;  Setting up ange ftp
;;
;;      Here is my settings, which you can use as a reference so that you
;;      get the ange running. For more details, see the ange-ftp.el's
;;      source code. These settings include firewall "ftpgw.example.com"
;;
;;          ;; (setq ange-ftp-generate-anonymous-password t)
;;          (setq ange-ftp-dumb-unix-host-regexp  "tntpc") ;PC hosts
;;          (setq ange-ftp-gateway-host "ftpgw.example.com")
;;          (setq ange-ftp-smart-gateway t)
;;          (setq ange-ftp-local-host-regexp "\\.myhost\\.\\(com|fi\\)|^[^.]*$")
;;          ;;  Always use binary
;;          (setq ange-ftp-binary-file-name-regexp ".")
;;          (autoload 'ange-ftp-set-passwd "ange-ftp" t t)
;;          (setq ange-ftp-generate-anonymous-password "jdoe@example.com")
;;
;;  How to use this module 3 -- special vc
;;
;;      There are some extra commands that you may take a look at.
;;      See source code of bind function
;;
;;          tinydired-default-other-bindings
;;
;;      What additional commands you get when loading this module.
;;
;;      The VC special commands were programmed, because I felt that the
;;      C-x v v in dired mode didn't quite do what I wanted. I wanted
;;      simple ci/co/revert commands for files that were in VC control.
;;      And I wanted to handle them individually, expecially when ci'ing.
;;      (written for Emacs 19.28).
;;
;;      This VC part of the package is highly experimental.
;;      I'm not sure if I support it in further releases.
;;
;;  Important ange-ftp interface note
;;
;;      The ange ftp batch interface used here may cause unpredictable
;;      problems. Sometimes the `get' or `put' process doesn't start at all
;;      although you see message saying it started the job. I have had
;;      several occurrances where `lcd' cmd succeeded, but then nothing
;;      happened. Repeating the `put' or `get' command cleared the problem
;;      whatever it was.
;;
;;      So, never trust the message `completed', unless you saw that the
;;      download percentage count started running. If you're downloading
;;      important file, double check the real ftp buffer for correct response.
;;      Try again if ftp wasn't started. Another way to clear the problem: kill
;;      the ange ftp buffer and try the command from dired again. It
;;      automatically opens session to the site.
;;
;; Advertise -- other useful packages
;;
;;      There are exellent dired extensions around, please consider getting
;;      these packages:
;;
;;      o   dired-sort.el (requires date-parse.el)
;;      o   dired-tar.el
;;
;;  Note: Slow autoload
;;
;;      When you have added the autoloads into your .emacs, the first time
;;      you bring up dired buffer may be quite slow. This is normal, Emacs
;;      just need to load some additional files that this package uses.
;;
;;  Note: Refreshing the view takes long time / point isn't exatly the same
;;
;;      This is normal, dired is just slow and program has to do lot of
;;      work to maintain the "view". Eg. save view, save marks, delete
;;      marks, revert, sort, restore marks... Only the current line
;;      position is preserved where user was, not point.
;;
;;  Note: Code
;;
;;      Emacs ships with package `dired-x.el', which seems to offer some
;;      more goodies to dired. Currently, if the `dired-x' is detected the
;;      appropriate functions in this package are diabled, to prevent
;;      overlapping behavior. However, if the function behaves differently
;;      than the one in some dired extension package, then the function
;;      isn't disabled. Eg. see `tinydired-load-all-marked-files', which can turn
;;      off marks.
