;;; Install:

;; Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp `load-path', add following into your
;; ~/.emacs startup file
;;
;;      (require 'tinylib-ad)

;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, 1999
;;
;;      This is lisp function library, package itself does nothing.
;;      It modifies existing Emacs functions with advice.el in order
;;      to provide backward compatibility for functions that have changed.
;;      E.g. Emacs 20.4 introduced new parameter NOERR to `require' command.
;;
;;      Load this library first and continue using your current Emacs
;;      version. This package will redefine functions only when
;;      needed, so it should be quite safe.
;;
;;	2010-11-29 Note: These compatibility functions are obsolete, now
;;	when Emacs is at version 23.x
;;
;;  Usage
;;
;;      This package cannot be autoloaded.
