;;  This package also installs function `tinychist-command-history-load' in

;;; Commentary:

;;  Preface, apr 1996
;;
;;      In newsgroup post to gnu.emacs.help there was discussion about
;;      saving and restoring emacs command history between session. Fred G.
;;      Athearn <fga@maple.sover.net> sent a help message to a person
;;      asking for it describing how to print out command-history and
;;      saving it into a file with `C-x' `C-w'. This little package tries
;;      to automate everything, so that when you load it, it will
;;      automatically load command history for the right emacs and when you
;;      exit emacs, the command history is saved to disk.
;;
;;  Overview of features
;;
;;      o   Save and restore emacs command history
;;      o   Suport simultaneous emacs sessions, different history for
;;          each one. Eg. "-name Mail" is associated with "mail" emacs history,
;;          "-name News" is associated with "news" history. This trick works
;;          on non-windowed tty too, since the switch is evaluated and cached
;;          internally in those cases.
;;
;;  Default save file from -name parameter
;;
;;      The default save name of command history file is extracted from
;;      the frame parameter. It is quite customary that people have
;;      several emacs open in their X display, each one dedicated to
;;      specific task.
;;
;;      The key here is, that you should make a habit of naming your
;;      emacs by task when you start it:
;;
;;          % emacs -name Mail &        # My mail emacs
;;          % emacs -name C++1 &        # My C++ project 1
;;          % emacs -name News          # for news reading
;;
;;      This effectively sets the frame's name to "-name" parameter's
;;      value. But old emacs versions are a little picky about the order of
;;      command line options, please look at the info pages in which order
;;      you must specify additional arguments. (info pages, Node:Initial
;;      Options) For non-windowed environment, this trick doesn't quite
;;      work out of the box, because emacs doesn't accept the name option
;;      at all. Let's try to start fresh emacs to an xterm, not to separate
;;      frame and see what happens. Order of the options is important here.
;;
;;          % emacs -nw -q -name Mail  &
;;
;;      What happens, is that you get two new buffers: "-name" and "Mail",
;;      and this is not what we intended. If we ask the frame name in this
;;      emacs, it says "terminal" or something similar. What we do instead,
;;      is ,that we install our own command line handler in non-windowed
;;      emacs and then we're able to intercept the "-name" option and it's
;;      parameter. When the emacs is killed, we then again look at the
;;      cached "-name" option to derive the save file postfix. If you're
;;      interested in adding your own command line option, see function
;;      ti::add-command-line-arg in tinylibm.el
;;
;;  How it works
;;
;;      Your emacs must support `kill-emacs-hook', so that the command
;;      history can be saved automatically when you exit emacs. If you have
;;      older than 19.xx, or other emacs that doesn't support the variable,
;;      there is alternative example which replaces you emacs exit. See at
;;      the end of file for examples. When emacs loads, the
;;      `tinychist-load' is runs (see installation) and correct
;;      `command-history' file is loaded.
;;
;;  File saving/loading
;;
;;      If you want to save/load the history session manually, you can call
;;      function
;;
;;          M-x tinychist-command-history-save
;;
;;  About using the frame name
;;
;;      I know it's a bit risky to rely on the frame name's first word,
;;      that it designates the purpose of your emacs. After all you _can_
;;      change the frame name to whatever you want in side emacs. But in
;;      general, the name labels your emacs and gives visible clue in X
;;      where the particular emacs is used to. (in non-X you can't see the
;;      name parameter at all, but I don't think that's a problem.)
;;
;;  See also
;;
;;      See file *chistory.el* in your emacs distribution, how to configure
;;      some parameters. E.g.:
;;
;;          M-x command-history-mode
;;          (setq list-command-history-max 50)
