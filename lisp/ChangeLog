        The code is GPL.

        impulse came from `folding-check-folded'.

        and 'bindforce' etc. Forgot that this was list of features

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-info-kill-buffers): 1.160 New.
        Kill hidden info buffers.
        (tinypath-info-initialize): 1.160 Moved logic to
        `tinypath-info-kill-buffers'.
        (tinypath-cache-file-save): 1.160 New.
        (tinypath-info-scan-Info-default-directory-list): 1.160 Use
        `tinypath-cache-file-save'.
        (tinypath-directory-list-clean): 1.160 Activated the `pushnew'
        to filter duplicates.

2004-01-25 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinylisp.el (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): 1.89 Added
        `stringp' test for FILE.
        (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): 1.89 Improved error detection.
        If `locate-library' fails, it returns nil.
        (tinylisp-symbol-file-location): 1.89 New.
        (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): 1.89 Moved logic to
        `tinylisp-symbol-file-location'.

2004-01-24 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinylibm.el (ti::color-lighter): 1.91 New.

2004-01-23 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyef.el (tinyef-mode): 1.58 Clarifies documentation.

2004-01-22 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinylisp.el (tinylisp-:menu-main): 1.88 Removed
        documentation for key `x'. There is no such key, it's `X'.

2004-01-21 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyliba.el (top-level): 1.92 Moved cl.el fixing code to
        function `ti::tmp-cl-library-check'. Now always turns off
        tinypath.el advices

2004-01-11 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyliba.el (top-level): 1.91 The `dolist' and `return'
        check needed a fix for tinypath.el, which was called due to
        adviced `load-library' function. It must be deactivated.
        Added code to check `tinypath'.

2004-01-06 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-regenerate): 1.158
        function wiped out all user added directories because
        there was a call to `tinypath-original-values'. Added
        check for null `load-path' and only then the
        `tinypath-original-values' is called.

2004-01-05 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyadvice.el (shell): 1.76 It was not intuitive
        to ask user to rename the OLD shell buffer. Chnaged the
        advice so that new name is given to the NEW *shell*
        buffer created.

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-tmp-find-root-home): 1.158 Added
        Debina /root directory check. Added UID 0 check and
        call to `user-uid'.
        (tinypath-tmp-find-writable-dir): 1.158 Changed
        `root-user-p' test to use `user-uid' instead of
        expanding ~ and testing it to be / (which is not the
        case in all systems)
        (tinypath-tmp-find-writable-dir): 1.158 ROOT user was always
        discriminated. The cond-statement whould have terminated
        more earlier to expand the ~. After that the checks kick
        in. Fixed.

        * tiny/tinyvc.el (tinyvc-install-to-emacs): 1.59 Changed
        to use `with-currnet-buffer'
        (tinyvc-install-to-emacs): 1.59 Wrong call, must be
        `turn-on-tinyvc-mode'in' if-statement.
        (tinyvc-install-to-emacs): 1.59 Added skiping buffers
        which have no `buffer-file-name'.

2003-12-31 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-p-2): 1.157 Absolute
        path name was not correctly handled. Not the path is returned
        as is.

2003-12-11 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyurl.el (tinyurl-command-table-default-1):
        Changed 'url method to use `browse-url-generic'
        instead of `browse-url-netscape'.
        (tinyurl-command-table-default): Changed
        `browse-url-default-browser' to
        `browse-url-default-windows-browser'
        (tinyurl-table): Removed `error', not only prints
        `message'

2003-12-10 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyurl.el (tinyurl-overlay-plist): Moved after
        `tinyurl-table-current'.
        (tinyurl-table-current): No more calls `error' if
        there is no match for TABLE parameter. The
        return value is simply nil.
        (tinyurl-mark-line): If `tinyurl-overlay-plist'
        returns nil, then there is no known URL handler and user
        must fix browse-url.el `browse-url-browser-function'
        (tinyurl-:file-filter-table): Added GIMP to
        view jpg and image files

2003-12-09 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinylisp.el (HARNESS): Renamed to
        `tinylisp-:harness-flag'

2003-12-08  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-use-compression-maybe):
        Documentation string fixed.
        (tinypath-file-compressed-p):
        Documentation string fixed.
        (tinypath-cache-warn-if-not-exist): Removed call
        to `file-name-nondirectory' before call to
        `tinypath-use-compression-maybe'. Unnecessary.
        (tinypath-cache-p-2): Whole logic rewritten. Cache
        level 2 syntax changed. Was (package path), is now
        (package . path). Fixed bug where level 2 was populated
        from full scan by using level 1 elt.
        (tinypath-cache-p-1-new): Absolute path is also
        one like ~foo/. Added tilde to regexp.
        (tinypath-cache-p-1-new): term/vt100 is now searched
        as package vt100 and not simply ignored.
        (tinypath-cache-display): New.
        (tinypath-load-path-directory-files): Removed
        `nreverse'. The order is not important.
        (tinypath-cache-p-2): If new file was found, it was
        incorrectly placed to level 1 cache like
        (package (0 . /path/to/package.el)). That should have
        been (package.el (0 . /path/to/)).
        (tinypath-cache-setup): `read-cache' check rewritten.
        (tinypath-load-path-directory-files): Removed `dont-regexp'
        which ignored backup files [#~]. The function cached all
        filed, but that needed improvement. Now caches only .el
        and .elc files. Added regexp to `directory-files'.

2003-11-06 Thu    <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyperl.el (tinyperl-pod-by-module): 1.93
        looked only files ending .pm, but e.g. POSIX.pm's documentation
        is in POSIX.pod. Now looks first PACKAGE.pod before PACKAGE.pm

2003-10-28 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-:option-table): 1.104 Removed

        (tinypath-emacs-root-directory): 1.138 Improved.
        Now use `invocation-directory' if possible.
        (tinypath-expand-file-name): 1.138 Added more logic and
        prevented calling `expand-file-name' if possible.
        (tinypath-expand-file-name-variable-macro): 1.139 Use
        `cons' instead of `pushnew' for speed.
        (tinypath-directory-subdirs): 1.139 Use
        `cons' instead of `pushnew' for speed.
        (tinypath-directory-list-clean): 1.142 Use
        `cons' instead of `pushnew' for speed.
        (tinypath-:win32-p): 1.144 New.
        (tinypath-gnus-load-path-list): 1.147 Renamed. Was
        `tinypath-gnus-load-paths-list'
        (top level): 1.149 Added autoload 'pp'. Do not `require'.
        Added autoload `executable-find'. Do not `require'. Moved
        (require 'advice) inside `eval-when-compile'.
        (tinypath-cache-file-hostname): 1.154 Renamed. Was
        `tinypath-cache-file-hostname'.
        (tinypath-cache-file-load): 1.154 Removed call
        `tinypath-cache-file-need-sync-p'.
        (tinypath-cache-file-old-p): 1.154 Documentation fix.

        * tiny/tinylibmail.el (ti::mail-ip-at-point-1): 1.83 New.
        (ti::mail-ip-at-point): 1.83 Use `ti::mail-ip-at-point-1'.
        (ti::mail-whois-parse-records): 1.83 Improved checking.

2003-09-22  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyigrep.el (tinyigrep-main-read-args): 1.85 Removed
        `ext' (like *el), because it was offered in wrong prompt.
        It is not a database choice, but a file pattern choice.

2003-09-15 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinydiff.el (tinydiff-:patch-program): Paren in
        wrong position. Fixed.

2003-09-14  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el: At the beginning of line the word 'Id'
        was in separate line (must have been a RET press mistake).


        * tiny/tinymailbox.el (tinymailbox-:menu-main): Menu
        structure error. Calling menu item ` o' signalled an
        error. There was extra `call-interacively' call. Removed.

        message.
        (tinymailbox-occur): Added check for empty string (RET).

        `funcall'. It's faster to call `search-backward' and
        `search-forward' directly.

        * tiny/tinyadvice.el
        -- All extra advices that were disabled by defualt was removed.
           They never seem to be used for anything.

        list `tinypath-Info-default-directory-list'. This must be

2003-09-08  Jari Aalto <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyperl.el

        `executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p' signals

        Added parameter MIDDLE.

        * tiny/tinymy.el (tinymy-install-mouse-movement-handler): 1.80
        Too restrictive regexp 21.[12], because the problem is still
        in Emacs 21.3. Now regexp rules out all Emacs 21 versions
        under windows.

        * tiny/tinyurl.el: 1.71 Added win32 check. under Linux,
        Netscape is not longer dominating, but Mozilla, Phoenix or Opera.

        `done'.

        `win32' check, because that prevented calling
        `tinypath-expand-file-name', which expanded paths. Without
        call to it, there remained duplicate paths in tilde(~)
        format and trailing slashes.

2003-06-25 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinylib.el (ti::process-java-version): 1.99 Under

        which asked o save buffer also in case when user wanted to diff

        'word-!-word' and there was only one spcae, then the function did
        nothing. Now call `delete-horizontal-space'.
        (tinyeat-delete-whole-word): 1.63 Documentation string cleared.
        (tinyeat-:bind-install-type): 1.64 Chnaged default type from

        BODY, check more closely if `tinytab-indent-by-tab-width' can be
        called. function `tinymail-complete-guess-in-headers' is now
        removed from `tinymail-:complete-key-hook' while point is in body

2003-06-06  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-p-2): If package was moved on
        disk, the cahe was invalid. So full scan was used and a new entry
        was put in cache level 2. However the cache format was errorneous:
        '(name (number path)) => '(name (number . path)). This was serious
        error and made whole package useless, because cache format was
        corrupted.

2003-06-06 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-:verbose-timing): 1.120 Extra `nil'

        1.62 Added Cygwin support. CAn not read /cygdrive/ path names from
        compilation buffer, when user wants to replace the results of
        tinyigrep.el searches.

        * tiny/tinyigrep.el (tinyigrep-cygwin-executable-fixes): 1.78
        igrep.el's default value for `igrep-find-program' is `find', which
        is not good under Win32, because it could match Windows version of
        `find'. Now searches cygwin version under Native NT Emacs.
        (ti::expand-file-name-cygwin-macro): 1.78 Activate advice
        `shell-quote-argument' under Win32 NT Emacs/Cygwin

2003-06-03 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinymail.el (tinymail-complete-headers-nothing-found): 1.73
        If no completions was found, functon fun `forward-word'. This
        is non-intuitive. Removed.
        (tinymail-from-set-field): 1.73 Incorrectly updated field
        `X-Draft-From:' under message-mode. Call to `ti::mail-kill-field'

        package is not intuitive enough for casual user.

2003-06-02  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinytab.el (tinytab-region-bounds): Nasty bug fixed.
        If point was at the beginning of line, first TAB advanced ok,
        but next tab returned back to original position! Problem was
        in the return value for single line. It must be nil, not
        range beg-end=of-line.

        multiple completions, message was flashed at minibuffer.

        `tinylisp-:mode-define-keys-hook' and
        `tinylisp-:elp-summary-mode-define-keys-hook'

        (tinymail-install-table-header-complete-gnus): 1.71 All Header
        completion entries were broken. Trying to complete Gnus `Gcc'
        would not do anything. Fixed `aput' clauses that needed extra
        `list' for KEY.
        (tinymail-complete-simple): 1.71 Changed `cdr' to `nth 1'
        to read the `tinymail-:table-header-complete'.
        (tinymail-header-complete-choices): 1.71 New.
        (tinymail-complete-key): 1.71 Use `ti::mail-field-email-address-p'.
        (tinymail-complete-guess-in-headers): 1.71 Added
        check for `ti::mail-field-email-address-p'.
        (tinymail-complete-headers-nothing-found): 1.71 Added
        `forward-word'. User can TAB to move forward headers and words.


        * tiny/tinypath.el
        -- FIXED: Latest performance improvements introduced new bugs.
        (tinypath-cache-p-2): 1.117 When doing full
        scan, the `push' command put invalid entries '(package path)
        into cache, when it should have put '(package (position path)).
        This broke lot of things that read cache.
        (tinypath-cache-setup): 1.117 Call to `tinypath-insinuate-gnus'
        was misplaced. This function must always be called because there
        must be only ONE gnus available for Emacs. Otherwise Emacs might
        pick any files from various Gnus versions (just happened).
        (tinypath-info-display): 1.117 New user function.

        * tiny/tinyigrep.el
        --  FIXED: Grepping under Native win32 + Cygwin dindn't work
            at all because the advice code `expand-file-name' was
            never activated.
        (ti::expand-file-name-cygwin-macro): 1.77
        Moved here.
        (tinyigrep-cygwin-binary-p): 1.77 Added .sh check
        (tinyigrep-igrep-call): 1.77 Simplified and used
        `ti::expand-file-name-cygwin-macro'.

        * tiny/tinylibxe.el (ti::expand-file-name-cygwin-macro): 1.60
        Moved to correct library tinyigrep.el

2003-05-22 Thu    <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-exec-path-check-verbose): 1.116
        Improved message display.

2003-05-21 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyliby.el (ti::system-unload): 1.61 Changed `while'
        to `dolist'.

        * tiny/tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-:option-table): 1.96 Added
        new library `tinylibenv'.

        * tiny/tinyliba.el (require): 1.83 Moved environment code to
        separate library.

        * tiny/tinylibenv.el (require): NEW FILE. Moved code from
        tinyliba.el
        (ti::file-version): Renamed. Was `tinyliba-file-version'.
        (ti::emacs-debug-mode): Renamed. Was `emacs-debug-mode'.
        (ti::turn-on-emacs-debug): Renamed. Was `turn-on-emacs-debug'.
        (ti::turn-off-emacs-debug): Renamed. Was `turn-off-emacs-debug'.

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-p-2): 1.111 If package was
        removed from disk or moved to another location, the cache
        was not purged from invalid entries. Now
        entry is deted from `tinypath-:cache-level-two' and
        `tinypath-:cache' and full directory scan is done to locate moved
        file.
        (tinypath-cache-p-2): 1.111 Moved
        `tinypath-cache-warn-if-not-exist' call here.
        (load-library): 1.111 Removed `tinypath-cache-warn-if-not-exist'
        (load): 1.111 Removed `tinypath-cache-warn-if-not-exist'
        (autoload): 1.111 Removed `tinypath-cache-warn-if-not-exist'
        (tinypath-cache-p-1-new-cache): 1.111 Didn't set variable
        `elt' correctly. This is important, because without the
        cache value, the element cannot be removed from cache.
        Added '(throw-ignore (setq elt'.
        (tinypath-cache-p-1-old): 1.111 Removed. The new code is
        reliable now.
        (tinypath-cache-p-2): 1.111 Added non-nil `elt' check
        before calling `delete'.

        * tiny/tinylibxe.el (expand-file-name): 1.60 Winth native Win32
        Emacs + igrep.el + tinyigrep.el, there was a problem with calling
        the databases. The problme was function `igrep.el::igrep' whic
        called `shell-quote-argument' that caused havoc on file names.
        The advice code undoes the effect.

2003-05-20 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinylib.el (ti::vc-version-string-p): 1.94 New.

        * tiny/tinypath.el
        -- NEW FEATURE: It is now possible to save the cache file
           in cmpiled format for speedier startup. Just set
          `tinypath-:cache-file-postfix' to `.elc'.
        -- Cache lod time with compiled cache is 50 % faster. Load
           time has reduced from 6 seconds to 3 seconds.
        -- FIXED: Gnus version number check didn't work.
        (tinypath-byte-compile-file): 1.110 New.

        support.
        (tinypath-cache-file-name-all): 1.110 New.
        (tinypath-cache-file-delete): 1.110 Updated. Must delete
        both .el and .elc files.

        Read environment variable COMPUTERNAME in case HOST is not set.
        Added `downcase'.
        (tinypath-:cache-file-postfix): 1.111 Chnaged default value to
        `.elc', was `.el'
        (tinypath-path-ok-p): 1.114 Free variable `ver' fixed.
        (tinypath-cache-file-need-sync-p): 1.114 Free variable `file'
        fixed.
        (autoload): Added `ti::pop-to-buffer-or-window'.

2003-05-19 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinymy.el (tinymy-file-stamp): 1.77 Added check
        against empty `user-mail-address' (variable doc2).

        * tiny/tinymail.el (tinymail-mail):
        -- FIXED: tab key didn't complete in Mail headers.
        1.69 Wrong function was
        inserted into `tinytab-:tab-insert-hook'. Not
        `tinymail-complete-key', but `tinymail-complete-key-interactive'
        is correct.
        (tinymail-complete-key-remove-itself): 1.69 New.
        (tinymail-:complete-key-hook): Change `nil' value to list
        of hooks. They are also set by calling `tinymail-install',
        but if user forget's to run that, this the default value
        in the variable is a safeguard.
        (tinymail-:cc-kill-regexp): 1.69 Added check for nil
        `user-mail-address'.
        (tinymail-from-anti-ube-maybe): 1.69 Added check for
        `user-mail-address'
        (tinymail-:report-mail-notify-program): 1.69 Improved checking
        with `let' form.
        (tinymail-default-report-mail-command): 1.69 If there is
        ~/.procmailrc, show message to user, but do not die. Removed
        `error' call.

        * tiny/tinyliba.el (ti::emacs-type-win32-p): 1.83 Fixed. Dind't
        check `ti::win32-p'.
        (ti::os-check-linux-p): 1.83 New.
        (ti::emacs-type-unix-like-p): 1.83 New.

        * tiny/tinylisp.el (tinylisp-:menu-main): 1.76 Documentation
        error. E = elint.el, e = elp.el
        Added `defun' test. Elp can instrument only functons from
        buffer.

        * tiny/tinypath.el
        -- Cygwin XEmacs 21.4.10 fixes.
        -- Profiled package with elp.el under Cygwin XEmacs. Loading
           4500 files from cache took initially 28 seconds. After
           improvements it now takes 6 seconds. Greates improvement was
           gained by fine tuning `tinypath-directory-list-clean' -7 sec.
           Next big things was a bug that caused full load-path
           scan if filename was absolute (as ti happens when cache is
           loaded). This improved -8 secs.
        (tinypath-cache-p-1-new): Incorrect handling
        of files like 'term/vt100.el'. It was treated as absolute
        path because the test was made with `file-name-directory'.
        Changed to better string-match test.
        (tinypath-cache-p-1-new): 1.110 Split the logic into
        `tinypath-cache-p-1-new' and `tinypath-cache-p-1-new-cache'.
        (tinypath-:compressed-file-extensions): 1.110
        (tinypath-file-extension-compressed): 1.110 Added `reverse'
        to make the order of extensions same same in
        `tinypath-:compressed-file-extensions'.
        (tinypath-message-log-max-sym-value): 1.110 New.
        (tinypath-list-display): 1.110 set Message display
        size so that all paths can be displayed.

        (tinypath-load-path-match): 1.110 New.
        (tinypath-load-path-initial-value-xemacs): 1.110 Added
        Check if xemacs-packages is already in load path, then
        do nothing.
        (ti::win32-cygwin-p): 1.110 Updated code from tinyliba.el,
        more recent patch handles Cygwin better.
        (load): 1.110 Removed `tinypath-time-macro', It's better to use
        elp.el ot other means.
        (require): 1.110 Removed `tinypath-time-macro'
        (tinypath-directory-list-clean): 1.110 Added check for win32
        can call
        (tinypath-load-path-clean): 1.110 Rewritten.
        (tinypath-path-ok-p): 1.110 Removed `file-directory-p' test,
        because that was already tested in
        `tinypath-directory-list-clean'.
        (tinypath-cache-file-need-sync-p): 1.110 New.
        (tinypath-load-path-not-in-synch-p): 1.110 Added option FAST.
        (tinypath-cache-setup): 1.110 Added condition checks what
        functions to run. Only if cache changes, run function
        `tinypath-load-path-reorder' `tinypath-insinuate-gnus'. This
        will speed up startup.
        (tinypath-directory-list-clean): 1.110 Added win32 check.
        Expand filena names only in Native Win32 Emacs/XEmacs.
        (tinypath-load-path-search): 1.110 Added `tinypath-verbose-macro'.
        (tinypath-cache-p-2): 1.110 New.
        (tinypath-cache-p): 1.110 Split into two parts: detect
        absolute paths and do not continue. After check, pass search to
        function `tinypath-cache-p-2'.
        (tinypath-:install-flag): 1.110 New.
        (tinypath-exec-path-check): 1.110 Added Trailing slash check
        `file-name-as-directory'.

2003-05-15 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyeat.el (tinyeat-:bind-install-type): 1.60 Bind
        only `alt-key'
        (tinyeat-install-default-bindings): 1.60 Keybinding
        ESC-backspace changed to use `kbd' macro. That is more
        safer to bind `tinyeat-erase-buffer'
        (tinyeat-install-default-bindings): 1.60 Added `kbd'
        binding `M-DEL', alt-backspace to run
        `tinyeat-backward-preserve'. Used `kbd' to bind

        A file could be originally under version control
        tool, which is not in format N.N, like N.N.N. This
        is not a suitable start value for rcs -k to preserve
        keywords. Do nothing if version number looks complex.

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-:cache-file-hostname-function):
        nil value is no longer default. Always use HOST prefix

        * tiny/tinyperl.el (tinyperl-version-stamp-re-search-forward): 1.79
        Made `my|local|our' definition before $VERSION variable optional,

        (Docuentation): improved.
        (tinyef-:mode-key-table): 1.55 Unconvenient

        Must use

        * other/folding.el (folding-uninstall): 2.108 Folding was removed
        from all hooks, but the buffers stayed in folding mode. Now
        calling uninstall will terminate folding-mode in every Emacs

        * tiny/tinyadvice.el (vc-do-command): 1.66 Added check if
        file contains ',v'. For some reason `(vc-registered file)'
        returns nil. The FILE argement was passed as file.txt,v in
        Emacs 21.2 and Cygwin 1.13.9.

        * tiny/tinylib.el (ti::xe-mouse-call-original-function): 1.86

        * other/folding.el: 2.106 Applied patch from plasma
        <plasmaball@pchome.com.tw> (sent 2002-10-31). The folding markes
        do no longer require starting name: '{{{ MARKER', but can be
        started with plain '{{{'. Files generated this way are compatible
        with `vim' editor setting `set fdm=marker'.

        * tiny/tinyliba.el: Removed autoload of
        `vc:hook.el::vc-buffer-backend', there is no such function in
        Emacs 21.2

        * tiny/tinyadvice.el (vc-mode-line): 1.66 Incorrect
        advice argument set, was 1 => `vc-mode-line' only has
        argument 0.
        (vc-mode-line): 1.66 Corrected backend detection problem.
        Always assumed RCS, when CVS was also possible. Fixed.
        (vc-mode-line): 1.66 REplace home made code with
        call to `(vc-file-getprop file 'vc-workfile-version)'.

        be suprising effects.
        (tinytab-indent-by-tab-width): Call `tinytab-tab-forward-insert'
        if there is no region to indent.

        * tiny/tinylib.el (ti::xe-mouse-call-original-function): 1.86
        Added flyspell support. When tinyurl.el mouse-2 was pressed, and
        if flyspell was active, nothing happened under point where
        flyspell did not see anything to correct. Now the flyspell is
        checked in advance and disabled as needed to find out the
        original mouse-2 function to call, which usually is `yank'.

        * tiny/tinyurl.el (tinyurl-dispatcher): 1.65 Added two `and'
        tests to check for non-nil before continuing. Like if the
        overlay for URL was not there, there is no point to
        run other functions.
        (tinyurl-call-original-mouse): 1.65 Incorrect mode detection
        (symbol-name 'major-mode) => (symbol-name major-mode)
        (tinyurl-call-original-mouse): 1.65 Do not test against function
        `yank', because it is `mouse-yank-at-point' under Emacs 21.2.
        Added `emacs-p' test and reading mouse event `button2' under XEmacs.

2003-01-21 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyperl.el (tinyperl-version-stamp): 1.78

        (tinytf-:saved-comment-start): 1.83 New.

        * tiny/tiny-setup.el (defvar): 1.90 Typo: `autolaod' =>
        `autoload' in statement `tinylisp-install'.

2002-12-31 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyurl.el (tinyurl-dispatcher): 1.64 Extra character
        `s' removed.

2002-12-31  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyreplace.el (tinyreplace-:menu): Added `f' key
        to run `tinyreplace-replace-forward'. More intuitive for a
        novice user than the default `5' key. It is assumed that not all
        userd bound `tinyreplace-menu' to M-%.

2002-12-23  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinylisp.el (tinylisp-:load-hook): Removed

        (w32-expand-file-name-for-emacs): New.

        * tiny/tinyigrep.el
        (tinyigrep-igrep-call): New.
        (tinyigrep-main): Removed general code. Call `tinyigrep-igrep-call'.
        (tinyigrep-as-last-time): Incorrect expand-file -syndrome under
        Win32 Emacs / Cygwin. Now calls generic `tinyigrep-igrep-call'
        which sorts out the OS dependent things.

2002-12-18 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyperl.el
        FASTER STARTUP - DEFERRED skeleton.el loading

        (tinyperl-skeleton-initialize): New.
        Added call to `tinyperl-skeleton-setup' at the end of file.

        if user calls the skeleton functions, they trigger loading
        skeleton.

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tmp-tinypath-cache-p): 1.103 Incorrect
        variable `package' was used to check cache level TWO.
        This never found term/linux.el correctly. Fixed to use
        loop variable `file'

2002-12-14  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-info-handler): Added variable
        `cleanup' which forces rebuilding info structure if new
        directory was added to `Info-default-directory-list'.

        Removed window environment fast keys
        Control-( and Control-). Binds standard Emacs key C-x).

        * tiny/tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-tinycomment-bind): Aded option
        FORCE. Mistakenly always overwrote key M-;
        (tiny-setup-tinydesk-bind): changed keys sreu to uppercase
        `ctl-x-4-map' keys SREU.
        (tiny-setup-tinyef-bindextra): Incorrect function name.
        Was `tiny-setup-tinyeat-bindextra'.
        (tiny-setup-tinyigrep-bind): Changed key from C-cg => C-cG
        which should not clash user's binding so much.
        (tiny-setup-tinyindent-bind): Wrong mode was bound.
        `tinytab-mode' => `tinyindent-mode'.
        (tiny-setup-tinymacro-bind): Removed window environment fast keys
        Control-( and Control-)
        (tiny-setup-define-key-1): print key binding message in double

        not look good.
        (tiny-setup-tinyreplace-bind): Removed.
        (tiny-setup-tinyreplace-bindemacs): Moved key from M-% => M-& so that
        it does not clash Emacs default key binding.

        and .elc, so that extension is stripped away only in those cases.
        Say you have file this.is.me.el and searched (locate-libraty
        this.is.me) => code mistakenly reduced search to `this.is',
        because the extension was unconditionally removed in any case.
        (tinypath-emacs-versions): Added CACHE for eamcs verions.
        (tinypath-emacs-root-by-load-path): Use cache

        (Emacs 21.2 fix). Also check `file-exists-p' before
        `find-file-noselect' -- which would create an empty
        buffer if there were no file.

        * tiny/tinylibb.el: 1.69 eshell-mode.el is still broken
        in Emacs 21.2, where it defines alias 'ignore for

        overriden. Of cource, user knows what he does when he
        requests 'force, but new Emacs version may define keys

        * tiny/tinytf.el (tinytf-install-add-log): 1.65 Rewritten.
        Now the add-log variable is set locally to buffer
        when `tinytf-mode' is turned on and killed from the
        buffer when `tinytf-mode' is turned off.
        (tinytf-install): 1.65 Removed `eval-after-load'
        for `add-log.el'.
        (tinytf-mode): Call `tinytf-install-add-log' on
        mode de/activation to add ChangeLog support.

        * tiny/tinybookmark.el (tinybookmark-goto): 1.53
        Non-existing function `fold-show' => `folding-show-current-entry'

        * tiny/tinylisp.el (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): 1.59
        If buffer is folded or outlined, open the narrowing
        before searchng for function.

2002-01-24 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinymailbox.el (tinymailbox-font-lock): 1.59 Can't
        use `window-*' functions to get bounds, because the window
        may not be visible. Now use 50 line approximation.
        (tinymailbox-mode-candidate-p): 1.59 New. Added check
        for Gnus, rmail and vm buffers.

        * tiny/tinyurl.el (tinyurl-guess-line-number-at-point): 1.55
        Unmatched \\) in last regexp.

        * other/folding.el (folding-bind-default-keys): 2.99 Added
        C-x . to run `folding-context-next-action'. Code by
        Scott Evans <gse@antisleep.com> during mail exchange.
        (folding-easy-menu-define): 2.99 Added
        `folding-context-next-action'
        (folding-mouse-call-original): 2.99 Added `car-safe' to read
        EVENT, which may be nil.
        (folding-next-visible-heading): 2.99 Better variable
        name `bm' => `begin-mark'
        (folding-bind-backward-compatible-keys): 2.100
        Used `let' to locally set `folding-mode-prefix-key', but that
        did not accept a thing, because `folding-install' instantiated
        the keymap using `folding-mode-prefix-key', which retained the
        original value. Now sets permanently `folding-mode-prefix-key'
        to C-c.

        * tiny/tinylisp.el (tinylisp-face-print): 1.59 Renamed.
        Had odd looking name `*-ti::xe-', which was due to global
        search and replace that was done few days back.
        (tinylisp-face-list-unique): 1.59 New. Took logic
        out of `tinylisp-face-print'. Easier to debug.
        (tinylisp-face-list-unique): 1.59 `font-lock-warning-face'
        doe snot seem to be valid face in this system. Give warning on
        invalid faces.

        * tiny/tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-package): Incorrect
        regexp 'load\\force' prevented setting up 50% of
        the options, because there was wordk `autoload' that
        was matched. Corrected. Now M-x tiny-setup enables
        rest of the features.

        * tiny/tinymy.el (tinymy-package-save-get-file-name):
        Some packages in gnu.emacs.sources do not start with
        triple comments ';;;' but ';;'. Changed the search
        regexp to cope with this.

        ************************************************************
        RADICAL CHANGES - tinylib{m,a} Library functions altered.

        Use `ti::package-package-require-timer'
        and not (ti::use-package-emacs 'timer 'itimer)

        * tiny/tinymy.el: 1.54
        Use `ti::package-package-require-timer'
        and not (ti::use-package-emacs 'timer 'itimer)

        * tiny/tinypgp.el: 1.54
        Use `ti::package-package-require-timer'
        and not (ti::use-package-emacs 'timer 'itimer)

        (ti::directory-up): 1.61 Rewritten. Now handles Cygwin
        and dos paths as well as Unix paths.

        Was `ti::use-package-emacs'
        (ti::package-require-view): 1.60 Renamed. Was
        `ti::use-package-view'
        (ti::package-require-mail-abbrevs): 1.60 Renamed. Was
        `ti::use-package-mail-abbrevs'

        * tiny/tinylisp.el (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): 1.58 Added
        support to search functions and variable names that do not
        start to the right. This means that functions defined within
        `eval-and-compile' can be found from current buffer
        if keys($ ') are pressed under function name in `tinylisp-mode'.

        * tiny/tinydiff.el: 1.59 Clarified installation section.

        * tiny/tinymailbox.el (turn-on-tinymailbox-mode-maybe): 1.58

        tinyperl.el will also populate those buffers.

2002-01-22 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinymy.el (tinymy-:compile-table): 1.54 updated regexps

2002-01-22    <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-info-handler): incorrect
        call to `substr'. Missing the DIR argument. This was
        serious error and prevented using the package if new
        info files were found.

2002-01-19 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinymailbox.el (tinymailbox-find-file-hooks): 1.57
        Incorrect placement of paren.

        * tiny/tinylibm.el:
        Instantiate `define-key-after' advice in Emacs prior 21.1

        * tiny/tinylib-ad.el: 1.54 Added Emacs 21.1 compatibility
        `define-key-after'. E.g. you cannot use newest ibuffer.el
        without this advice, because it relies on Emacs 21.1
        features.

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-info-handler): 1.67 Prevent adding
        same INFO dir multiple times. The directory may be in format
        ../info or ../info/. Check both.
        (tinypath-cache-setup): 1.67 Removed extra clean (copy/paste error)
        tinypath-directory-list-clean => tinypath-:extra-manpath
        (tinypath-info-initialize): 1.67 Added call to
        `tinypath-Info-default-directory-list-clean'

2002-01-17 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinymailbox.el (tinymailbox-find-file-hooks):
        Exclude certain files for mailbox checks: *.tmp *.log
        .procmailrc, VM, RMAIL.

2002-01-15 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-install-environment-user):
        LOGNAME 'Linux error' was displayed in W2k. This is
        incorrect. Added test fro (not (tinypath-win32-p)).

2002-01-14 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyperl.el (tinyperl-perldoc): 1.60 Added
        (get-buffer-create tinyperl-:perldoc-buffer). There is
        no initial POD buffer.
        (tinyperl-:pod-font-lock-keywords): 1.60 Added four space
        Heading with color: ' ? ? ? ?'. Accpepted only 2 spaces
        at front previously. See File::Basename listing.
        (tinyperl-:pod-font-lock-keywords): 1.60 The NAME display
        corrected, lik ein File::Basename. Previously only highlighted
        first entry, now handles all. See File::Basename *pod* display.
        (tinyperl-:pod-font-lock-keywords): 1.60 Changed
        chmod(1) links to `font-lock-constant-face'.
        Was `font-lock-type-face'

        * tiny/tinypath.el (require): 1.65 Moved `xemacs-p' definition
        indside `eval-and-compile', because byte compiler must see it.
        (tinypath-install-environment-user): 1.65 (getenv USER) portion
        had parens in wrong order. Fixed.

        * tiny/tinydesk.el (TinyDesk): 1.54 Incorrect call
        `ti::defgroup-tiny' => `ti::package-defgroup-tiny'

        * tiny/tinytf.el: 1.63 Adde Byte Compiler notice
        (defvat add-log-current-defun-header-regexp)

        (tinybuffer-iswitch-to-buffer): 1.52 Show `major-mode' for
        files as well in iswitch mode.


        * tiny/tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup): 1.70 Added 'TinySetup: Done.'
        message, because seeing
        TinySetup: Key "j"     (C-cj) set to `tinyxreg-jump-to-register'
        as a last message makes user wonder 'when does it finish?'
        (tiny-setup-package): 1.70 Missing `list' argument to
        function `prin1-to-string'.

2002-01-13 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinydesk.el (ti::defgroup-tiny): 1.53 Wrong macro
        call, was `ti::defgroup'.

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-info-handler): 1.64 Print
        verbose message if there is no files to handle in DIR.
        (tinypath-info-directory-contents-update): 1.64 Removed
        `interactive'. User should call `tinypath-info-handler'.
        (tinypath-info-handler): 1.64 Added `tinypath-info-initialize'
        to the end if called interactively. This forces regenerating
        info files and new additions will be seen.

2002-01-12 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinydired.el (tinydired-:download-dir): 1.54
        2 separate VALUES in `defcustom' declaration, but only one
        is allowed. Removed extra value.
        (tinydired-:backup-file-regexp): 1.54 Added
        ignore regexp for CVS style `.#ChangeLog.1.3288' files.

        * tiny/tinylibm.el (ti::package-defgroup-tiny): 1.58
        `:func-args' now passes (symbol-name (quote (, symbol))),
        where it used to be plain symbol, which broke custom.el.
        Site address updated to http://tiny-tools.sourceforge.net

        * tiny/tinyadvice.el (save-some-buffers): 1.55 New advice saves
        abbrevs without extra confirmation.
        (tinyadvice-:advice-table): 1.55 Added `save-some-buffers'.

        * tiny/tinypath.el (tinypath-info-directory-contents-update):
        1.64 Removed extra unused `and' statement.
        <Douglas_Gray@trilogy.com> suggested changes to info entry
        generation in mail
        http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/8673/0/7453688/
        referring to Miguel's mail
        http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/8673/2001/6/0/5970411/
        But the code seems already updated according to Miguel's
        instructions.
        (tinypath-install-environment-user): 1.64 Now only sets USER
        variable in Windows systems. In Unix checks both LOGNAME and USER.
        Rearranged code according to ideas by <Douglas_Gray@trilogy.com>
        in message

        * tiny/tinytf.el (tinytf-utility-programs-check): Too loose
        error handling if files were not avilable. Tightened.

2002-01-09 <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinygnus.el (tinygnus-gnus-summary-catchup-with-read-all):

        * tiny/tinymy.el (tinymy-install): 1.52
        `tinymy-mouse-movement-handler' cannot be installed under win32,
        because Emacs 21.1 ha a bug which makes constant redisplay.
        In Unix Emacs the handler works ok. Added test for Win32.

        * tiny/tinyigrep.el (tinyigrep-install-default-databases): 1.53
        Increased count from 23 => 25, because the countdown showed
        -2 at the end.

        * tiny/tinypath.el: 1.58 Added `car-safe' to read the
        Emacs version number. It returned '(20.7 20.7.3) in

        * tiny/tinypath.el (startup): Added more checking for USER,
        LOGNAME and environment, because LOGNAME may be set, not
        necessarily USER. The message is now also better tailored

        specific message in Unix host....

        * other/folding.el (folding-fold-region): XEmacs latex-mode

        (tinyperl-perldoc): 1.56 Rewrote whole function. Now uses logic
        from `tinyperl-perldoc-1' by first trying with -f and if no
        results, runs without -f.

        * tiny/tinylib.el (ti::p-perl-process-environment-macro): 1.57

        `tinyhotti::list-find-buffer'

        are preferred before TEMPDIR and TMP.
        (tinydiff-patch-cleanup): do not print any messages

        'Tinydiff: Correcting patch: done.' gave wrong impression.
        (tinydiff-block-region): Removed (forward-line -1) which
        took one one too much to the diff block.

        If text buffer was smalled than window, the `window-end' returned
        wrong value. This causes range error with `font-lock-fontify-region'
        Now select `point-min', in case it is smaller than `window-end'.
        (tinytf-:font-lock-keywords): Added windows \r codes next to \n

        (tinytag-post-command): Added extra call to
        `tinytag-:set-database-hook', so that the idle command
        doesn not procedd if there is no support for current language.
        The `tinytag-:set-database-hook' is called multiple times
        in the code (redundancy), but it is so quick and good for
        debugging, so I dind't remove extra calls.
        (tinytag-install-sample-database): The default database HP-UX
        is not quite ocmplete. Now installs the net BSD database under
        win32/Cygwin.

        (tinydiff-patch): Removed tinydiff-shell-command and used
        more portable `call-process' to call gzip.

        expression to detect correct TF file. The old regular expression
        expected two alpha-ascii characters at the start of heading,
        like "This", but the heading may also start like "L90". Now
        accepts alpha-uppercase followed by non-whitespace.


        * tiny/tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-turn-on-tinytf-mode-maybe):
        Added better TF detecting: check heading Level 1 and 2, not just
        TOC to decide if TF is turned on. Error in `remove-hook': it
        never uninstalled itself.

2001-11-19  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinypath.el: Added argument TRADITIONAL, which makes
        it possible to call Emacs Lisp cache method.
        (tinypath-cache-setup): Added argument TRADITIONAL.

2001-11-16  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyliby.el (ti::y-enable-disabled-options): Emacs 21.1
        byte compiler fix: `arg' variable put into `let'.

2001-11-15  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinylibb.el (ti::xe-character-define-macro): This macro fixes
        some ill behaving packages that redefine XEmacs compatible
        functions as `ignore'. The macro restore the correct definition.
        (eshell): Now loads `eshell' and fixes nasty in eshell-2.4.1, which
        breaks compatibility. Not checked if it has been corrected
        in newest eshell version.

2001-11-15  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinymail.el (tinymail-report-update): The Mail report function
        never run, because the buffer tinymail-:report-spool-buffer was
        never created. Bug reported by Clemens Beckstein
        <beckstein@informatik.uni-jena.de>
        (tinymail-report-get-mail-info-string): In New Emacs, `concat' cannot
        concatenate numbers. Added `number-to-string'. Bug reported by
        Clemens Beckstein <beckstein@informatik.uni-jena.de>
        (tinymail-report-mail-install): Added missing %s format specifier
        from the printed ON/OFF message. Bug reported by
        Clemens Beckstein <beckstein@informatik.uni-jena.de>

2001-10-31 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyliby.el (ti::y-enable-disabled-options): 1.50 New
        user function.

2001-10-28 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinytf.el (tinytf-:font-lock-keywords): 1.50
        Moved 'Big letter words' font-lock regular expression
        later in the list, so that reference [] takes
        precedence.

2001-10-27 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinylisp.el (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): 1.50
        Mistake in regexp. If searching for `functions-test' it could
        position point at `function-test-this'. Now requires that the
        NAME follows WHITESPACE [ \t\r\n].

        * tiny/tinypath.el
        (tinypath-gnus-versions): 1.50 Added `tinypath-expand-file-name'
        because in XEmacs, the call `file-name-as-directory' uses \\
        in Win32. We want consistent forward slashes.
        (tinypath-admin-remove-matching): 1.50 Kills second level cache
        so that it is rebuild later.
        (setq tinypath-:cache-level-two nil)
        (tinypath-gnus-load-path-list): 1.50 clip the found path so that
        the last directory is gnus/ which is supposed to be gnus installation
        root location.
        (tinypath-cache-p-1-new): 1.50 Didn't respect
        `tinypath-:load-path-ignore-regexp'. Fixed.
        (tinypath-load-path-remove): 1.50 Added backup method.
        If REGEXP mistakenly would clean whole load-path, restore it.
        (tinypath-load-path-remove-cache): 1.50 New.
        (tinypath-admin-remove-matching): 1.50 Call
        `tinypath-load-path-remove-cache'

2001-10-24 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinylibm.el (ti::bool-toggle): 1.50 If argument was nil
        or t, it never toggled the argument. This meant that calling any
        mode by name (M-x xxx-mode) always turned the mode on, never off.
        Rewrote whole macro.

2001-10-23 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tinyliba.el (win32-shell-p): New.

        * tiny/tinydiff.el (tinydiff-compose-diff-filename): Win32
        does not understand tilde reference in path format ~/tmp.
        Added `expand-file-name'
        (tinydiff-diff-show): Added `expand-file-name'
        tinydiff-:diff-tmp-file if `win32-shell-p'.
        (tinydiff-patch-with-diff-1): Added `expand-file-name'
        tinydiff-:diff-tmp-file if `win32-shell-p'.

2001-10-22 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-autoload-read): 1.52
        The directory structure was changed and there is no more
        tiny-autoload-loaddefs-lisp. trying to load that file
        caused an error. The load command was removed.

2001-10-11 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-autoload-read): Autoload file
        changed `tiny-autoload-loaddefs-lisp' => `tiny-autoload-loaddefs-tiny'

2001-10-08 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny/tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-autoload-batch-update): 1.50
        Require slash in DIR.
        (tiny-setup-autoload-build-functions): 1.50 Set
        `make-backup-files' to prevent making backups.

        * tinylisp.el (top-level): 1.63 Checked all http://
        links and added dates. Changed instructions to 'you have to
        upgrade your emacs' for critical files.

        * tinyigrep.el (tinyigrep-perl-pod-support): 1.38 Wrong function
        `execuable-find' => `executable-find'

        * tinydired.el (tinydired-get-marked-files-no-dir): 1.24
        Byte compile error in XEmacs 21.4.3
           evaluating (< nil 0): (wrong-type-argument number-char-or-marker-p nil)
        Which is caused by code
        (dired-map-over-marks
           (tinydired-get-filename)
             nil))
        Which macroexpands somewhere along to
           (if (< nil 0) (nreverse results) results))
        Which triggers the XEmacs compile error. There is nothing that could
        be done because the macro is defined dired.el

        * tinyadvice.el: 1.30 Correct `vc-parent-buffer' definition
        (defvar vc-parent-buffer nil) => (defvar vc-parent-buffer)

        * tinylib.el (ti::w-find-bottom): 1.72 Removed `window-loop'
        and used `dolist'. Byte compiler error.

        * tinyliba.el: 1.47 Added autoloads from vc-hooks.el and vc.el
        Emacs 20.7.3. Needed in tinyreplace.el

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-default-exclude): 1.58 `put'
        had too few arguments. Wrong varaible name `list' =>
        `exclude-list'
        (tinyurl-find-url-php-compile): 1.58 Quiet variable `line'
        XEmacs 21.4.3 Byte compiler error fix.

        * tinytab.el ("tinytab.el"): 1.20 Duplicate
        `ti::m-fmacro-version-bug-report' removed.

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-install): 1.65 Extra variable
        `ok' removed.
        (tinyperl-install): 1.65 Extra variable `failure' removed.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-cycgwin-p): 1.140 Byte compiler
        fiX: non-exixting `executable-find'
        (tinypath-use-compression): 1.140 Wrong cal `errror' => `error'
        (tinypath-emacs-core-path-p): 1.140 Wrong variable
        `ver' => `version'
        (tinypath-set-default-value-macro): 1.140 Added test
        `tinypath-byte-compile-running-p'
        (tinypath-cygwin-p): 1.140 Extra variable `root' removed.

        * tinylibb.el (w32-cygwin-mount-point-to-dos): 1.28 Byte
        compiler errors fixed: lifted defun-maybe
        and used plain defun.
        (subst-char-in-string): 1.28 Added autoload definition.
        XEmacs 21.4.3 Byte compiler error.

        * tinylibm.el: 1.58
        Byte compiler errors fixed: removed defsubst-maybe radix,
        hex-to-int, rand0, font-lock-mode-maybe
        (ti::bool-toggle): 1.58 Rewritten. More accurate macro.
        XEmacs 21.4.3 Byte compiler signalled error
        ** evaluating (< nil 1): (wrong-type-argument number-char-or-marker-p nil)
        with the code snippet, where it couldn't understand
        that the `integerp' test was doen before `<'. Here is the code:
        (and (integerp nil) (< nil 1))
        (ti::temp-file): 1.58 Extra variable `val' removed.

2001-10-06 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylisp.el (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): 1.63 Failed to find the
        function definition if it did not have spaces after NAME:
        (defun name (). Now accepts (defun name()

2001-10-04 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylibm.el (ti::expand-file-name-tilde-in-string): 1.57
        Expanding ~user paths in Win32 does not make sense.
        The error was found while using tinydiff.el to compare
        files and Win32 reported temporary directory name
        as g:/DOCUME~1/ADMINI~1.000/LOCALS~1/Temp

        * tinyigrep.el (tinyigrep-install-default-databases): 1.37
        Parse errror in tinyigrep-:perl-pod-path. Added missing paren.

2001-10-02 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinydesk.el (tinydesk-install): 1.36 New. INstall or
        uninstall package. Add hook to `find-file-hooks' to activate
        state edit mode if tinydesk state file is loaded.
        (turn-on-tinydesk-mode): 1.36 New.
        (turn-off-tinydesk-mode): 1.36 New.
        (turn-on-tinydesk-mode-maybe): 1.36 New. Activated from
        `find-file-hooks'

2001-09-27 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyperl.el
        (tinyperl-cache-file-name): New. No more use fixed
        variable, but construct a dynamic cache file name.
        (tinyperl-load-state-if-recent-enough):
        Use `tinyperl-cache-file-name'
        (tinyperl-save-state): Use `tinyperl-cache-file-name'
        (tinyperl-:cache-file-postfix): New.
        (tinyperl-:cache-file-prefix): New.

        * tinypath.el
        -- NEW FEATURE IMPLEMENTED. Variable
        tinypath-:load-path-accept-criteria (t) says that the search
        criteria for package location is as follows
        1) User comes first  2) non-Emacs installation (site-wide)
        3) Emacs installation. Thie means that is you download
        cperl-mode.el and drop it to your HOME directory, the
        cperl-mode.el in Emacs installation is ignored.
        (tinypath-external-helper-call): Added message
        if the output from EXT process was empty. There must be something
        wrong if that happens.
        (tinypath-emacs-root-directory): New.
        (tinypath-load-path-initial-value): Use
        `tinypath-emacs-root-directory'
        (tinypath-load-path-locate-library): New.
        (tinypath-:load-path-accept-criteria): New.
        (tinypath-cache-p): Call `tinypath-load-path-locate-library'
        for higher level control of what package is accepted.
        (tinypath-emacs-core-path-p): New.
        (tinypath-emacs-root-by-load-path): Use
        `tinypath-emacs-core-path-p'
        (tinypath-load-path-locate-library): Use
        `tinypath-emacs-core-path-p'
        (tinypath-main): New. Used to be plain `progn'
        (tinypath-expand-file-name-variable-macro): 1.138 Added `reverse'
        to preserve the original order. Without the reverse, it caused
        rebooting tinypath.el every time, because the order
        of the path changed at startup.This made it think that
        user had changed paths and called EXT process to scan disk again.

2001-09-26 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-turn-off-tinypair-mode): 1.25
        `turn-off-tinypair-mode' is installed into `minibuffer-setup-hook',
        so before you get into the prompt, this hook is run. BUT, if
        the hook fails, you never get into prompt. This is very serious.
        Added safeguard so that package existence is checked
        first, before call to `turn-off-tinypair-mode' is attemped.

2001-09-26  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-use-compression): `tinypath-cache-p' is
        not the correct way to find out path for jka-compr.el. Added
        `locate-library' and PANIC message if the core library is not
        found.

2001-09-26 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinydesk.el (tinydesk-:save-title): 1.35 Added more informative
        state file header with instruction how to reload state file.

2001-09-25 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymy.el: 1.49 Installation document clarified:
        AUTOLOAD section rewritten and the code changed with better
        one.

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-default-exclude): In dired buffer
        message 'TinyUrl: Excluded buffer' kept displaying all
        the time. The cause of this message was that the idle
        timer expired and it consulted exclude function if the
        mouse-2 should have URL jump feature. This was repeated
        every time Emacs was idle and user worked in dired.
        Now added cache of already excluded buffers to the `plist'
        so that no further checking is done if buffer was already
        excluded.

2001-09-24 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylib.el (ti::unix-man-path-root): 1.71 New. Created
        new category for Unix/Cygwin related functions under ti::unix
        (ti::xe-installation-root): 1.71 New.

        * tinyigrep.el (tinyigrep-:perl5-path): 1.36 Removed. Only
        executable `perl' is now offered, not `perl5'.
        (tinyigrep-install-default-databases): 1.36 Removed perl5
        support. only `perl' is offered.
        (tinyigrep-install-default-databases): 1.36 Added new datases
        `home-Mail' which searches ~/Mail and `home-News' for ~/News
        respectively.
        (tinyigrep-install-default-databases): 1.36 Added safeguard nil test
        for `tinyigrep-:perl-inc-path'
        (tinyigrep-man-path-root): 1.36 New. Cygwin supported.
        (tinyigrep-:man-path-root): Now defcustom, a user variable.
        (tinyigrep-:perl-pod-path): 1.36 Now defcustom, a user variable.
        (tinyigrep-:perl-inc-path): 1.36 Now defcustom, a user variable.

        * tinytab.el (tinytab-indent-region-dynamically): 1.19
        Beatified lisp code by lifting )))'s to their proper places.


        * tinytf.el (tinytf-text-format-p): 1.63 Added a special case
        to detect TF files. If text file started with two headings: level 1
        + level 2, everything was fine. Level 1 + regular text, fine.
        But it didn't detect file that started with level 1 + Heading 3
        (at column 7). Now fixed. Added support for column 9,10 as well.

        * tinylibb.el (w32-cygwin-mount-table): 1.27 Cygwin mount table
        read failed. Removed `shell-command' and used faster `call-process'.

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-pod-path): 1.61 Perl 5.6.1 Changed
        the pod path, at least in Cygwin it is under
        PERL-INSTALL/VERSION/pods. It used to be in
        PERL-INSTALL/VERSION/pod
        (tinyperl-:cache-file): 1.62 Made the cache file Emacs flavor specific.
        This is needed to support Cygwin perl.

2001-09-23 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylibb.el: 1.26 New.
        (w32-cygwin-mount-point-to-dos): 1.26 New.
        (w32-cygwin-mount-table-set): 1.26 New.
        (w32-cygwin-path-to-dos): 1.26 New.
        (w32-cygwin-mount-table): 1.26 New variable.
        (w32-cygwin-mount-table-parse): 1.26 New.

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-install-main): 1.61 New. User can
        defadvice this function to disable it. Old version had
        statements at the end. Now they are grouped inside function.
        (tinyperl-install-variables-binaries): 1.61 SERIOUS error
        corrected. If user relocated Perl binary, old value was read
        from cache and the automatic relocator did not find correct perl.
        Suppose situation: A) cache says c:/Program Files/perl/perl.exe
        and new location was B) g:/bin/lang/perl/perl.exe. The regexp
        that derived the binary name read 'perl.*', which mistakenly
        returned portion perl/perl.exe from A, when it should had
        returned only perl.exe. => solution was not to use .* but
        [^\\/]* which drops path separator.
        (tinyperl-pod2text): 1.61 Added Warning message
        'pod2text was empty. Please check your perl env?, because if
        the pod2text function does not return anything, the perl
        installation must be messed up. (May happen if you install
        both Activestate and Cygwin Perl and keep 3rd party CPAN
        and PPM archives.)
        (tinyperl-:perldoc-bin): 1.61 Find Pure Cygwin `perldoc' which
        Emacs cannot.
        (tinyperl-:pod2text-bin): 1.61 Find Pure Cygwin `pod2text' which
        Emacs cannot.
        (tinyperl-executable-find-path): 1.61 Find Pure Cygwin program which
        Emacs `executable-find' cannot.
        (tinyperl-external-command-format): 1.61 New. Cygwin needs different
        call to `perldoc'.
        (tinyperl-perldoc): 1.61 Added call to
        `tinyperl-external-command-format' and code to support pure
        Cygwin `perldoc', which must be called as `perl perldoc' under
        Windows. This will also work in Unix.
        (tinyperl-inc-path): 1.61 If PERL5LIB contained only one windows style
        directory, like C:/site-perl/CPAN, the split function expected at
        least simicolon(;), but because it did not see one, it split
        according to (:) resulting `c' and `/site-perl/CPAN'. Oops. Fixed.
        (tinyperl-inc-path): 1.61 If @INC or PERL5LIB are pure cygwin paths
        like /usr/share/site-perl/CPAN, convert those to DOS format
        in GNU Emacs, which is native windows aplication.
        (tinypath-path-convert-to-emacs-host): 1.61 New.
        (tinyperl-pod-path): 1.61 If Config.pm doesn output the POD paths,
        terminate with error.

        * tinypath.el: 1.134
        (tinypath-info-default-path-list): New.
        (tinypath-:Info-default-directory-list)
        Rewritten. There is now new function
        `tinypath-info-default-path-list' which is consulted for possible
        info directories. The cygwin enwironment /usr/info and
        /usr/local/info are now located automatically.
        (tinypath-info-handler): 1.134 Made interactive. Uncommented
        the statement. Interactive call will cause incoking
        `tinypath-info-initialize', so that any new files are noticed.
        (tinypath-info-initialize): 1.134 Made interactive.
        (tinypath-info-directory-contents-update): 1.134 SERIOUS error
        corrected. Function never added new info entries to `dir'. The
        search condition was all wrong. Fixed.

2001-09-22 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-handler): 1.56
        Removed call (ti::select-frame-non-dedicated), because the
        agent function could not read the original buffer point
        any more. Moved the logic to agent functions.

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-:compile-table): 1.48 Added PHP
        interpreter cimpilation support on C-z c c

2001-09-09 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-package-require): 1.24 Changed
        (if (not => (unless
        (tiny-setup-tinysearch-bindmousemeta): 1.24 New. Meta and
        ALT keys require different binding.

2001-09-07 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyigrep.el: 1.35 Corrected documentation typos.


        * tinypath.el: Wrong function instructed in documentation.
        The hostname function is `tinypath-cache-hostname'.
        (tinypath-cache-hostname): Rewritten. Moved code from
        `tinypath-cache-file-name'.
        (tinypath-cache-file-name): Removed the HOST setting. This
        function always put the HOSTNAME to the cache file, even
        if the `tinypath-:cache-file-hostname-function' was not
        defined. Corrected. If `tinypath-:cache-file-hostname-function'
        is nil, no hostname part is added to the cache file. This
        makes it possible to run common cache file for all hosts
        in the network (the typical NFS mounted HOME directory
        situation).
        (startup): Better diagnostic message if Win2000 variable
        USERNAME was used to ser USER.

2001-08-28    <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny-setup.el (autoload): Added autoload for
        `turn-on-tinyef-mode' which is installed in minibuffer
        hook => running M-x was impossible and caused error because
        the mode couldn't be found.

2001-08-25 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny-setup.el (autoload): Added missing autoload for
        `turn-off-tinypair-mode'

2001-08-24 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-compile-run-command): Read type
        every time form buffer with `ti::id-info' and do not use cached
        value. Removed argument 'variable from `ti::id-info'

2001-08-22  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinypath.el

        Convert ti::bool-toggle => tinypath- ti::bool-toggle

2001-08-16    <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinypath.el (require): In w2k use USERNAME and copy its
        value to USER and LOGNAME.

2001-08-11 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinygnus.el (tinygnus-summary-mode): 1.36 Added reason why the
        mode couldn't be started: print `major-mode' in the message.

2001-08-08 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinydiff.el (tinydiff-diff-command-generate): 1.24
        call `file-components' rewritten. It's no more in the library.

2001-08-06 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinypath.el (require): Wrong instruction for BAT 'SET'
        commands. et USER=c:\johndoe =>  USER=johndoe

        * tinytf.el: VERB changed to name namespace clean version
        ti::verb

        * tinygnus.el: PMIN changed to namespace clean version
        ti::pmin.

        * tinylibm.el
         Following namespace clean-up was done:
        (ti::d!): 1.56 Renamed. Was d!   Affected all code.
        (ti::d!!): 1.56 Renamed. Was d!! Affected all code.
        (ti::window-pmin-line-p): 1.56
        Was `window-pmin-line-p'. Affected all code.

2001-08-05 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylib.el (ti::b-xtra-open-outline): 1.70 CAlled
        wrong function `save-with-marker' which was namespaced as
        ti::save-with-marker-macro. Fixed.

        * tinylibm.el (ti::temp-directory): 1.55 New.
        (ti::temp-directory): 1.55 Use `ti::temp-directory'
        Following namespace clean-up was done:
        (ti::pmin): 1.56 Renamed. Was PMAX. Affected all code.
        (ti::pmin): 1.56 Renamed. Was PMIN. Affected all code.
        (ti::verb): 1.56 Renamed. Was VERB. Affected all code.

        * tinylibb.el (read-directory-name): 1.23 Added
        defalias-maybe, for Eamcs compatibility.

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-pause-url-submit): 1.58
        Corrected Perl PAUSE submit URL address. Can't use
        https, because user hasn't been logged in yet.
        (tinyperl-pause-url-submit-www-page): 1.58 Renamed.
        Was `tinyperl-pause-url-submit'. Return valu is now
        complete file name, not just t.
        (tinyperl-pause-file-name): 1.58 New.
        (tinyperl-pause-copy-file): 1.58 Rewritten, Use

2001-08-03 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinygnus.el (tinygnus-group-mode): 1.33 Added missing
        menu entry for
        `tinygnus-group-set-current-level-region'

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-hostname): 1.122 New.
        (tinypath-cache-file-name): 1.122 Double check
        that HOST varaible is string. Protected in `concat'
        with if statement.
        (tinypath-:cache-file-hostname-function): 1.122
        The default value nil, did not act like documentation said.
        The cache file name should contain a HOSTNAME portion.
        Added `tinypath-cache-file-name'

2001-08-02 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinycomment.el (tinycomment-indent-for-comment): 1.10
        Added missing ###autoload

        * tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-tinycomment-autoload): 1.21
        Added missing autoload.

        * tinyadvice.el (vc-mode-line): 1.27 Advice didn't pay
        attention to variable `tinyadvice-:cvs-buffer-read-only'.
        If set to nil, all CVS buffers are always kept writable.
        This is useful in W2K where you are the only owner of the
        computer and you may happen to be logged in as someone
        else, but vc.el thinks the CVS file does not belong to you
        and makes the buffer read-only.

2001-08-01 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyadvice.el (tinyadvice-:cvs-buffer-read-only): 1.27
        Documentation cleared.

2001-07-27 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylibmt.el (ti::mt-field-email-send-p): 1.19
        Added argument HEADER-REGEXP.

        * tinymail.el: 1.56 Added Debian bug report headers for
        completion `Severity:' and `Tags:'
        (tinymail-complete-key): 1.56 Added possibility to complete
        email names in `Sender:' and `From:' field as well. Previously
        it was possible only in To, Cc, Bcc

2001-07-27  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-autoload-read): Added one more
        error symptom: Remove *.elc files and the problem goes away.

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-install): Emacs 21 fix: the
        mouse-movement-handler has changed in Emacs 21, so the
        automatic window change feature is currently
        disabled until the reason why it makes C-s and other keys
        unused is resolved.

        * tinymail.el: added top-level check for
        (string-match user-mail-address), so that address must be in
        form user@site.com. Otherwise in Win32 smtpmail.el would not
        connect to ISP's SMTP port. The default value in W2K systems
        is left as LOGIN@HOSTNAME, which is no god. Make user aware of
        this.

2001-07-25 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-command-table-put-2nd): 1.54
        After removing the `list-loop', the original construction
        did not match the design. The loop never substituted the
        KEYS in the property list. Loop corrected by aading
        (while list, added second `cdr' to the end of loop.

2001-07-22 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-rcs-make-filename): 1.68 Wrong
        parentheses corrected.

2001-07-21 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-time-test): 1.20 The libraries
        are no longer written in LIST. instead a path to tinylib.el is
        located and the content of the dir is searched for any
        `libraries'. In another words, the search dynamically find
        all files in question.

2001-07-20 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        call to `file-components'

        * tinyreplace.el (tinyreplace-replace-over-files-compile-buffer):
        1.13 Added `X' menu key to terminate the file replace loop.
        (tinyreplace-replace-over-files-compile-buffer): 1.13 Added
        check for backend 'RCS before doing co -l
        (tinyreplace-read-compile-buffer-filename): 1.13 Removed SPACE
        from filename regexp, because in Win32 the SPACE can be part of
        the filename and the directory. Added anchor `^cd' for more
        reliable base directory search.

        * tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-error-macro): 1.19
        Wrong `edebug-form-spec' corrected.

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-command-table-put): 1.53 Removed `list-loop'

2001-07-02  Jari Aalto  <jaalto@PICASSO>

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-split-win32-path): Added `reverse'
        to keep the original order of @INC paths.
        (tinyperl-inc-path): variable PATH5 (PERL5LIB content)
        was never set correctly. the `split-string' didn't include the
        varaible to split, so it always returned nonsense. Fixed.
        (tinyperl-install-variables-lookup): Removed duplicate code
        to set tinyperl-:inc-path (possibly previous copy/paste error)
        (tinyperl-build-list-of-inc-files): Added parameter SEARCH-LIST.

2001-07-01 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyadvice.el (texinfo-mode): 1.25 New. Integrated correction
        for Emacs 21.0, 21.1 by Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>, where
        texinfo.el always had syntax of double-quote and backslash
        characters as `whitespace'. This is now causing problem with Emacs
        21, because `picture-mode-exit' command now uses
        `delete-trailing-whitespace' with incorrect regexps.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-info-directory-contents-update): 1.120
        Integrated patch by Luis Miguel Hernanz <luish@uol.es> where it
        solves a small error with the generation of the 'dir' files. The
        current version didn't add the entries of the info files found.

        * tinylibm.el (read-char-safe-until): 1.53 Better error message
        for 'invalid list'. Now displays the content of passed LIST.
        (read-char-safe-until): 1.53 eshell-2.4.1/esh-mode.el
        mistakenly defines characterp to be 'ignore, make sure that the
        real characterp function is always working. Undo eshell's effect.

2001-06-30 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymail.el (tinymail-complete-list-bbdb-2): Added
        Additional check: is font lock active, before turning it off.
        (symbol-value 'font-lock-mode)
        (tinymail-bbdb-data-read): Added nil check for KEYS ONE and TWO.
        If either one is missing,  compose only ONE-VALUED key, not a key
        pair 'ONE TWO'. This error prevented seaching BBDB records that
        were keyed only by one string.

2001-06-26 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * other/folding.el (folding-mode): 2.92 make
        line-move-ignore-invisible buffer
        local, matches outline.el, and the 21 pre-release gets upset if this
        is defined globally in shell buffer. Fix reported by
        Robert Marshall" <robert@chezmarshall.freeserve.co.uk> and
        forwarded by Anders Lindgren <andersl@iar.se>

2001-06-25 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinytf.el (tinypath-:binary-t2html): 1.58 The code inserted
        'message' value with extra 'tinytf.el: ' prefix, when it should
        have inserted only absolute path to t2html.pl binary. Added
        PATH to be the last statement in `let', not the `message'.
        (tinypath-:binary-t2html): 1.58 Added `ti::f-path-to-unix',
        because the path name must contain forward slashes.

2001-04-28 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyadvice.el (Info-build-node-completions): 1.24 Applied
        patvh by  Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com> to correct the
        comment above the defun. (Feature is fixed in Emacs 21).

2001-04-26 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (turn-off-tinyurl-mode-1): 1.52 Typo.
        Documentation must say 'off', no 'on'.
        (turn-on-tinyurl-mode-1): 1.52 Documentation string
        typos fixed.

2001-04-18 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyadvice.el (Info-build-node-completions): 1.23 New.
        by Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>
        (tinyadvice-:advice-table): 1.23 Added
        `Info-build-node-completions' for Emacs 19.x and 20.x
        (ti::m-fmacro-version-bug-report): 1.23 Added missing autolaod
        for user function `tinyadvice-version'.

2001-04-17 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-create-maybe): 1.66
        Updated call name to macro `with-raw-write'

        * tinylibm.el (with-coding-system-raw-text): 1.52
        Renamed. Was `with-raw-write'. The new name will better appear
        in M-x appropos listing.

2001-04-16 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        SNAPSHOT RELEASED

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-find-url-php-compile): 1.51 Added Byte
        compiler quiet-statement for variable FILE. This function is
        not yet fully operational, because it's not clear if it
        is needed. The basic URL detection marker will find PHP
        error lines as well.

        * tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-autoload-batch-update): 1.18 The FORCE
        argument was not passed to function
        `tiny-setup-autoload-build-loaddefs-tiny-tools'. the fresh
        autoload file was never generated. Fixed.

2001-04-14 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-build-dir-1): 1.64
        Removed `generate-autoload-cookie' '^;;;###autoload', because
        the value is not really a regexp. It broke whole autolaod
        generation. Bug reported by Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>

2001-04-13 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-create-maybe): 1.63
        Use macro `with-raw-write' to ensure Unix line endings. Bug
        reported by Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>

        * tinylibm.el (with-raw-write): 1.51 New.

2001-04-12 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyadvice.el (find-tag): 1.22 New. Submitted by
        Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>
        (tinyadvice-:advice-table): 1.22 Added `find-tag'

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-build-dir-1): 1.62
        Set `generate-autoload-cookie' to more tighter regexp, including
        the start anchor ^. Core Emacs does not have it. This overcomes
        wrong autolaod generation in auctex/tex-info.el. Feature
        reported by Richard Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>

        * tiny-setup.el: 1.17 Speling typos with a patch sent by
        Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>

        * tinydiff.el (tinydiff-patch-check-if-load): 1.21 Added
        check for `global-auto-revert-mode' so that user is not asked
        if global reverting mode is active.
        (tinydiff-patch-check-if-load): 1.21 Added argument
        `full-diff' to indicate if full patch was applied. If makes
        sense to ask from user to reload the file only if full patch was
        applied. For individual hunks, the questions is too much of trouble.
        (tinydiff-patch-with-diff-1): 1.21 Send 'full flag to
        `tinydiff-patch-check-if-load' by checking `point-min' against
        the diff start position.
        (tinydiff-patch): 1.21 Added TYPE input argument.
        (tinydiff-block-apply-patch): 1.21 Send 'hunk to `tinydiff-patch'
        (tinydiff-patch-check-if-load): 1.21 Use `display-buffer' to
        show existing Emacs buffer, not `pop-to-buffer'.
        (tinydiff-patch-check-rejections): 1.21  Use `display-buffer'
        to show reject buffer, not `pop-to-buffer'.
        (tinydiff-patch-with-diff-1): 1.21 Use `display-buffer'
        to show patch-succeed buffer, not `pop-to-buffer'.
        (tinydiff-block-apply-patch): 1.21 Added `save-excursion' to
        prevent moving the current point.

        * tinylibb.el
        -- eshell-2.4.1/esh-mode.el  mistakenly defines characterp and
           char-int-p to 'ignore which breaks things. The new macro
           will return the correct defalias definitions.
        (ti::xe-character-define-macro): 1.21 New.
        (ti::xe-char-int-p): 1.21 New.
        (characterp): Now forced defalias in Emacs to fix eshell's definition
        (char-int-p): Now forced defalias in Emacs to fix eshell's definition

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-emacs-root-by-load-path): 1.118
        Added `stringp' test because the entry in load-path may contain
        nil values. According to docstring the nil is valid value and
        it means `default-directory' location.
        (tinypath-emacs-root-by-load-path): 1.118 Added check to require
        also requirement to have the 'lisp' in direcotry portion. Patch
        by Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>
        (tinypath-self-location): 1.118 Wrong match index 0 => 1. Patch
        by Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>
        (tinypath-self-location): 1.118 Spit function to smaller parts.
        Calls `tinypath-self-location-load-history'.
        (tinypath-self-location): 1.118 New.
        (tinypath-self-location): 1.118 Added `file-name-as-directory'
        before trying to check tinypath.el. Added final
        `tinypath-expand-file-name' conversion.
        (tinypath-external-setup-1): 1.118 Removed extra `laod-path' which
        should not be there. Patch by Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>.
        (load): 1.118 Wrong indexes for `nosuffix' 4 => 3 and
        `must-suffix' 5 => 4. Patch by Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>.

2001-04-11 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-pkg-autoload-create-on-file): 1.61 Changed
        `lisp-mode' to `emacs-lisp-mode'. lisp-mode This resulted in
        unbalanced parenthesis error on w3/lisp/font.el file. Changing this to
        `(emacs-lisp-mode)' fixed the problem. Bug reported by
        Richard Y. Kim <ryk@dspwiz.com>

2001-04-09 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylibid.el (ti::id-:buffer-match-regexp-list): 1.9 Corrected

        extra debug variable `EV'.
        (tinymy-define-keys): 1.42 Renamed. Was `tinymy-define-key'
        (tinymy-define-keys-extra): 1.42 Renamed. Was
        ``tinymy-define-key-extra'

        -- Autoload generation in XEmacs had serious troubles due to
        different path interpretation than in Emacs. XEmacs in Win
        uses dos\path, whereas Emacs Win32 uses unix/path notation.
        -- Now the autoload file can safely be generated with any Emacs
        version with command: perl makefil.pl -v 2 -b emacs autoload

        * tinylibmenu.el (ti::menu-menu): 1.10 Added mroe debug if the
        menu structure was not correct

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-load-path-personal-p): 1.117 Changed
        `tinypath-expand-file-name' to `expand-file-name' which is
        faster because we don't need the pure, Emacs independent
        path names here.
        (tinypath-default-load-path-root-user): 1.117 Added dearch for
        ~/.xemacs as well after ~/elisp and ~/lisp

        patch as well as unix/style paths. XEmacs  in Win21 returns
        dos\style paths.
        (ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-build-recursive): 1.60 Removed extra
        call to `ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-build-dir'.

        Made REGEXP an optional argument.
        (tiny-setup-directory-last): 1.14 XEmacs fix. The expanded path
        in Win32 uses dos\path names.
        (tiny-setup-directories): 1.14 XEmacs Win32 fix, take care
        or checking dos\path names.
        (autoload): 1.14 Added misisng autoload `tinymy-define-key-extra'

2001-03-27 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinytf.el
        -- Renumberin always started at SECOND heading. Now fixed.
        (tinytf-toc-goto): 1.56 Corrected. Return t now
        only of TOC was found.
        (tinytf-heading-start): 1.56 Corrected. Mistakenly moved
        always to SECOND top level heading. Now check the return
        value of `tinytf-toc-goto'.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-mode): 1.114 Added back
        advice for `load-library' to be in the safe side.

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-:compile-table): 1.40 Added support for
        running DOS bat files with C-z c c

        * tinylibid.el (ti::id-:file-extension-alist): 1.8 Added
        `code-bat' detection.
        (ti::id-:buffer-match-regexp-list): 1.8 Added
        `code-bat' detection.

2001-03-22 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        SNAPSHOT RELEASED

        * tinypath.el: New.
        (tinypath-load-path-reorder): New.
        (tinypath-cache-setup): Call `tinypath-load-path-reorder'.
        The path order should not matter, but there is one exception:
        The core Emacs itself. Usually you can download more recent
        version of the package from net and you want to ignore the
        version in Emacs core distribution. Gnus is a good example.
        The reorder function examined the found load-path values and
        separates those paths that are in core emacs distribution and
        moves them all to the end of list giving precedence to other
        paths.
        (tinypath-external-setup-1): Moved
        `tinypath-:original-load-path' first in the list.
        (tinypath-external-output-parse): Do not set variables, but
        call `lazy-lock-mode' and `font-lock-mode'
        (tinypath-external-output-parse-1-cache): Separate EMACS and
        OTHER paths so that Emacs core paths are put last in the cache.
        Used `append' to put these two together.

2001-03-21 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-define-key-1): Renamed. Was
        `tiny-setup-define-key'.
        (tiny-setup-define-key): New. Top level function.
        (tiny-setup-option-process): New.
        (tiny-setup-autoload-read): Added better diagnostics.
        (tiny-setup): It is now possible to suplly both TYPE and
        OPTION-LIST to add more option to the defaul installation,
        like requesting extra bindings, that are not installed
        by default: (tiny-setup 'all '(tinymy--bindextra))
        (tiny-setup-:option-table): Changed to `defconst'.

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-define-keys): Removed ti::ck key conversion
        calls.
        (tinymy-define-keys): Removed global setting for '%', so that
        user's don't get upset e.g. in Perl mode. Left the binding to
        lisp mode maps.
        (tinymy-define-keys): Removed binding C-x C-q, because many users
        may already use it for VC checkout and not the read-only.
        (tinymy-define-key-error): Changed `error' to `message' call.
        (tinymy-define-key-extra): New.

        * tinypath.el: Removed extra non-user plain string
        `tinypath-external-helper'.
        (tinypath-executable-find): Mistakenly
        returned directory! Now checks `file-directory-p'.

        * tinyliba.el (ti::q-read-input-as-password): Added missing
        autoload `ti::f-complete-filename-minibuffer'.

2001-03-21 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymail.el (tinymail-bbdb-data-read): Adjusted regexp.
        it dind't match person names that were in the form
        'FIRST FIRST FIRST' 'LAST' (like spanish names). It only
        expected 'FIRST' 'LAST'. Now completion is found for these
        people as well.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-p): Errors in cache checking.
        If file was moved or deleted, the cache-2 and cache-1 still
        returned the old location. This is not correct. A full
        load-path scan must be done to find the missing file. Added
        lot of code to handle this situation: Removed the cache-2
        entry when file lcation was invalid. Call
        `tinypath-load-path-search' as last resort. (slow)
        (tinypath-load-path-search): New.
        (tinypath-cache-p-1-extensions): New.
        (tinypath-cache-p-1-new): Took out the extension search portion
        to separate function.
        (eval-and-compile): typo. `istall' -> `install'
        (tinypath-:load-hook): Doc typo.
        (tinypath-:compression-support): Added option 'none. Patch by
        Luis Miguel Hernanz Iglesias <luish@germinus.com>
        (tinypath-directory-lisp-p): Renamed. Was
        `tinypath-direcectory-lisp-p'
        (tinypath-self-location): Expand FILE before doing the match
        for path location. Patch by
        Luis Miguel Hernanz Iglesias <luish@germinus.com>
        (tinypath-external-bin-location): Removed `file-name-directory'
        Patch by Luis Miguel Hernanz Iglesias <luish@germinus.com>
        (tinypath-:original-load-path): New. Patch
        by Luis Miguel Hernanz Iglesias <luish@germinus.com>
        (tinypath-install): Check variable `tinypath-:compression-support'
        for 'none, before turning on cache. Patch by Luis Miguel
        Hernanz Iglesias <luish@germinus.com>
        (tinypath-cache-mode): Do not advice `load-library' in Emacs,
        because it is a wrapper for `load' and would cause scanning
        the cache twice. Patch by Luis Miguel
        Hernanz Iglesias <luish@germinus.com>

        * other/folding.el (folding-find-file-noselect): New. Taken
        out of (defadvice find-file-noselect) for easier debug.


2001-03-20 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinytf.el (tinytf-install-hooks): Removed support for
        `post-command-hook'. This has too much troubles in XEmacs and
        it slows down typing. New Emacs releases have
        `post-command-idle-hook' which is more user friendly.
        (tinytf-install-hooks): Removed support for
        `post-command-idle-hook' since it is obsolete feature. Used
        idle timers instead.
        (tinytf-untabify): Renamed. Was `tinytf-post-command'
        (tinytf-idle-command): Removed `post-command-hook' and
        `post-command-idle-hook'
        (tinytf-mode): Removed call to `tinytf-install-hooks'. There is
        no point of removing the idle timer every time each buffer turns
        the mode ON or OFF.
        (tinytf-install): Renamed. Was ``tinytf-install-hooks'. Now called
        at the end of file, when the file gets loaded.
        (tinytf-install): Do not rely on `tinytf-:idle-timer-elt', but use
        more robust (ti::xe-timer-cancel-function 'tinytf-idle-command)

        * tinymy.el
        -- SERIOUS XEmacs error fixed.
        (tinymy-mouse-movement-handler): Added `eventp'
        test before extracting information from mouse event. Moved
        `event-window' (XEmacs) test first in `cond', because the second
        choice died in Win32 XEmacs 21.2.32

        * tinyurl.el: Adjusted :group `defcustom' statements to
        read in separate lines.
        Moved location of ###autoload `tinyurl-version'.

2001-03-19 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinypath.el
        -- If user had both ~/lisp (for common lisp) and ~/elisp, they
           were both added to the defaul load path list. No good. Now
           there is separate function to determine only ONE user Emacs
           lisp directory.
        (tinypath-cache-setup-scan): Added missing prefix
        `TinyPath:' to message string.
        Moved (autoload 'member* cl-seq) under `eval-and-compile', same
        place after the 'cl.
        Volker Zell, XEmacs 21.2  (beta45) reported about message:
        {SELF WARNING user did not load tinypath.el using absolute path,
        as instructed in installation} but this can't be true because
        tinypath.el was loaded with absolute path. After investigation,
        XEmacs didn't record the package path name to the load-history,
        if 'provide statement was at the end. Moved the 'provide to
        the beginning of file, so that the load-history entry is
        immediately available.
        (tinypath-default-load-path-root-user): New.
        (tinypath-default-load-path-root-dirs): Renamed. Was
        `tinypath-default-load-path-roots'
        (tinypath-direcectory-lisp-p): SERIOUS ERRORS.
        `file-exists-p' replaced with `file-directory-p'. The code did not
        return t id there were files lisp in the DIR.

        * tinytf.el (tinytf-toc): `cond' statement parens were
        wrongly placed. Error   ** Variable reference to nonvariable
        (t (message Tinytf: X-popu7p not available, no imenu.el).
        Bug reported by Marco Fioretti <marco.fioretti@tei.ericsson.se>
        There was no newline separating the level-0 headings. Code
        corrected by adjusting the `dolist' statement at top

2001-03-18 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-browse-url-browser-function):
        `browse-url-browser-function' can be (REGEXP . FUNCTION). This
        was not taken cared of. Bug reported by
        Dr. Volker Zell <Dr.Volker.Zell@oracle.com>. Added `dolist' to
        map over the FUNCTION names and find `netscape'

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-tmp-message): Renamed. Waw
        `tinypath-tmp-fatal-message'. chnaged all INFO: messages to
        read [INFO]. Changed all `defcustom' definitions to read
        :type and :group in separate lines.

        * tinytf.el (tinytf-toc): Added check if `imenu--mouse-menu'
        is not available, like in XEmacs 20.4. Now prints message
        for missing imenu.el.

        * tiny-setup.el (tinypath-tmp-autoload-file-footer): The last
        line dind't have lisp comment `;;' which made the autoload files
        invalid.

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-build-dir): Removed
        `ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-create-maybe' Because it always
        created the autoload file to a directory, even if there was no
        lisp files.
        (ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-build-dir-1): Rewritten. Added
        `ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-create-maybe'. This function is
        called only if lisp files are found. Added clearing hooks
        `find-file-hooks' and `write-file-hooks' because it makes
        no sense turning on `lisp-mode' when file is read for autoloads.
        (ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-create-maybe): Removed non-existing
        function `tinypath-tmp-autoload-file-footer'. Replaced with
        correct code and provide statement.

2001-03-17 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        SNAPSHOT RELEASED

        * tinyliba.el (tinyliba-file-version): New. Give better diagnostics
        when cl.el package is loaded and it does not defined macro `return'.
        Now findds out the cl.el version number and prints it to user.
        Bruce Ingalls <bruce@conde-dev.com> reported that the dysfunctional
        meessage was printed with SUMO dated 2001-02-02 with XEmacs v21.2b45

        * tinypgp.el:  Extra autoload `tinypgp-newnym-req-disable' removed.
        (tinypgp-r-chain): Extra variable removed.

        * tinyperl.el: Extra autoload `tinyperl-version' removed.

        * tinypair.el: Extra autoload `tinypair-version' removed.

        * tinypage.el: Wrong autoload `tinyeat-version' ->
        `tinypage-version'. Removed extra autoload `tinypage-version'

        * tinycompile.el: Removed duplicate autoload
        `tinycompile-version'

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-pkg-autoload-directories): New.

        * tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-error-macro): macro definition
        must have `progn'. Added.
        (tiny-setup-autoload-read): Replaces `msg' with `str' variable.
        (tiny-setup-autoload-read): Missing backslashed in from of
        double quotes in documentation string.
        (tinytf-:tinytf-mode-p-function): Removed.
        (tinytf-text-format-file-p): Removed.
        (tiny-setup-turn-on-tinytf-mode-maybe): New.

        * load-path.el (tiny-tmp-time-this): Extra variables a and b
        removed.

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-define-keys): Made interactive, because this
        is no longer run by default.

        * tinylisp.el (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): Added support for
        fincding `defmacro*'

        * tinygnus.el (tinygnus-summary-gather-urls): Be more cautious
        when using `turn-on-tinyurl-mode-1'.

        * tinytf.el (tinytf-toc-goto): New.
        (tinytf-heading-start): New.
        (tinytf-heading-macro): Do not got to `point-min', but
        `tinytf-heading-start'. This function affecteted everyhing to
        buildincorrect TOC and Mouse-1 popup menus.
        (tinytf-toc): Fixed the TOC generation, by correcting
        `tinytf-heading-macro'. z mounse-1 (imenu) popup generation
        was incorrect. Fixed.
        (turn-on-tinytf-mode-maybe): Added ###autoload.

2001-03-13 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * load-path.el (tiny-tmp-time-this): Calculate float time.
        (tiny-tmp-time-difference): Calculate float time.

        * tinylib.el (ti::d-time-difference): added optional flag
        `float' to calculate difference in float as well as seconds.

        * tinylibm.el (with-time-this): New macro.

        * tinyliba.el (imenu): Removed `macros' that are autoloaded,
        because XEmacs byte compiler flagged:
        ** The compiler ignores `autoload' except at top level.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-:startup-no-messages). New user variable.
        If installed site wide, the sysadm can set this variable to t, so
        that the buffer does not "jump to face" of a novice, but is
        cleanly logged to the *Message* buffer. For regular user, who
        istalls this file, it makes sense to display the message
        immediately.

2001-03-12 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyadvice.el (tinyadvice-:advice-table): Added autoload
        so that it can be changed by user. (Delete entries that
        user doesn't want)
        (tinyadvice-:cvs-buffer-read-only): correct
        documentation string to mention cvs watch on. Bug reported by
        david x callaway <dxc@xprt.net>

        * tiny-setup.el (tiny-setup-error-macro): New. Print error
        messages better to get user's attention. Creates
        buffer "*TinySetup Error*".
        (tiny-setup-defalias): New.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-default-load-path-roots): Added
        ~/.elisp and ~/.lisp. Some user's keep elisp files in these
        directories.

        * tinymail.el (tinymail-complete-simple): Make sure that the
        `info' parameter contains the completion string. Died on error.
        Added `stringp' test.


2001-03-11 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        SNAPSHOT RELEASED

        * tiny-setup.el
        -- NEW CONFIGURATION tool to setup all packages in the kit.
           At least those that can be configured automatically.
        -- Run function tiny-setup-display and C-h f
           tiny-setup
        (tiny-setup-:option-table): New.

        (tiny-setup-aput): New. More cautious `auto-mode-alist'
        manipulation.

        * tinylock.el: More precise autoloack password asking.
        If the password has already been set, don't ask it form user.
        Affects `tinylock-:load-hook'.

2001-03-10 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyxreg.el (tinyxreg-:load-hook): Removed
        `tinyxreg-default-keys' from load hook.

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-build-dir-1): New.
        (ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-build-recursive): FORCE flag
        was not passed in recursive call to
        `ti::m-pkg-autoload-loaddefs-build-recursive' thusly updated
        loaddefs.el and not the file that was asked.

        * tinyreplace.el (tinyreplace-interactive-region-args):
        If region was not active, unexpected error. Now prints descriptive
        error.


2001-03-09 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyigrep.el (tinyigrep-:load-hook): Removed
        `tinyigrep-install-default-key-bindings'

        * tinyappend.el (tinyappend-:load-hook): Set hook to nil.
        Functin `tinyappend-install-default-key-bindings' is no longer
        called.

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-pkg-install-pgp-tar): Added GPG support.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-time-record): New.
        (tinypath-time-macro): Moved fucntionality
        to `tinypath-time-record' for easier debugging.

        * tinylib.el (ti::p-tar-read-listing-forward): Regexp corrected
        to parse Cygwin / GNU tar output.

        * tinyad.el: RENAMED. Was `tinyad.el'. All variable
        and function prefixes start with `tinyadvice-'. Defcustom
        support added.

        * tinymailbox.el:  RENAMED. Was `tinymbx.el'. All variable
        and function prefixes start with `tinymailbox-'

        * tinybuffer.el: RENAMED. Was `tinycb.el'. All variable
        and function prefixes start with `tinybuffer-'

        * tinybookmark.el: RENAMED. Was tinybm.el.  All variable
        and function prefixes start with `tinybookmark-'

        * tinyvclog.el: RENAMED. Was tinyrlog.el. All variable
        and function prefixes start with `tinyvc-'

2001-03-08 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-tmp-fatal-message): Swapped `insert' and
        `message', so that a bug is always recoded even if `message' gives
        errors. Michael Luetzeler reported that it died and the reason
        was that message string included %USER%, which was not supposed
        to be a format string. LOGNAME and USER error message adjusted.

        * tinylisp.el (find-function): Test was misleading. In Emacs
        20.7 find-func.el comes standard but the message suggested
        that it was not found. This was a bug in `if' statements.

        * tinyef.el (tinyef-:mode-key): The defuat hot key C-c \ is
        not necessarily in comfortable location in every keyboard.
        Changed to C-c /.

        * tinypad.el (tinypad-mode-action): Corrected `prog' -> `progn'

        * other/folding.el:
        (advice find-function-search-for-symbol around): New advice to cope with
        C-h f and references in there.
        (advice find-file-noselect after): Open folding if called from
        `find-function-search-for-symbol'.
        Run checkdoc.el 0.6.1 and corrected errors.
        (folding-check-if-folding-allowed): Added code to prevent folding
        when and C-h v regerence like <test is a Lisp function in
        `~/foo/tmp/test.el' A flag gets set> was pushed.
        (folding-mode-find-file): Unfold buffer, what is, make sure it
        will be unfolded if folding is not allowed. This is nedded for
        the searches.

2001-03-07 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (turn-on-tinyurl-mode-1): Fatal error. Mistake
        in calling the 'turn on' function called itself indefinitely.
        Used correct function `tinyurl-mode-1'.

        * tinydiff.el (tinydiff-:auto-mode-alist): Wrong custom
        group 'TinyMbx corrected to 'TinyDiff.

2001-03-06 Tue    <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-scroll): PgDown error: If point was at the
        last line in the window, the page was scrolled. But the cursor
        was left at the TOP of next screen. Moved cursor to the BOTTOM
        of the current window (to indicate the going direction).

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-setup-scan): Added better verbose
        message when traditional method was used.
        (tinypath-external-helper-call): Print verbose 3 message (default)
        where theperl location is. This makes if possible to determine
        if a) perl was not found b) external utility was not found.
        (tinypath-self-location): Added `load-path' check if `load-history'
        fails. The warning message check was wrong: used variable `file'
        when should have used `ret' for testing.

2001-03-05 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-call-original-mouse): Added few checks
        before running yank. E.g check read-only buffers and do not
        `yank', in compilation buffers do not `yank'.
        (tinyurl-dispatcher): Call `tinyurl-call-original-mouse'
        Idea by Bruce Ingalls <bruce@conde-dev.com>

        * tinyprocmail.el: Added better install instructions. Correct typos
        in the menus.

        * tinypath.el: Added (autoload 'member* cl-seq). remove all caches
        files, compile tinypath, launch emacs. If I'm right, tinypath dies
        with a message of: "function member* not found". The key is
        compiling tinypath. If it is uncompressed, this problem doesn't
        occur. Bug reported by Luis Miguel Hernanz Iglesias

2001-03-03 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyad.el (vc-register): 1.20 New. If you're checking in
        file for the first time, the file may already contain version
        controlled information. This checks if you want to preserve the
        initial information with -k RCS switch.

        that the byte compiling is OK, although there may be
        missing files.

        * tinytab.el: Moved `ti::m-fmacro-version-bug-report' above the
        (require tinylibm) because the declaration must precede usage.

        * tinypath.el
        -- Interactive locate-library call fixed. (Didn't show path)
        -- Mystical error for Luis, where the old Emacs lisp method was used

           The performance looks overall good.

        From: Luis Miguel Hernanz Iglesias <luish@germinus.com>
        Subject: tinypath bug report
        Date: 2001-02-20

        * It doesn't compile because a problem with tinypath-:verbose (not
          defined).
          <fixed>
        * When compiled (defining tinypath-:verbose) it doesn't load
          because it can't find the definition of member*.
          <fixed>
        * I have discovered why I have had any problem with the perl
          companion of tinypath (emacs-util): I have not used it! because
          all the references to directories in my home directory gets
          removed from exec-path (I have emacs-utils in ~/bin), so it is
          not found and not executed.
          <I think this is fixed in later version>
        * Two more that I'm not sure if are already corrected: -
          locate-library doesn't return any result - absolutes references
          of the kind of (load "~/tinyload.el") are incorrectly looked up
          in the cache.
          <fixed>
        * I am not sure if you have fully implemented the idea of letting
          emacs-util decide which is the best version of each file (giving
          preference of user over system - already implemented I think -,
          compiled over no compiled, uncompressed over compressed). This
          would allow to search in the cache the root of the name of the
          file tinyload.el.gz->tinyload. So it would be sufficient with
          one search in the cache per file instead of six (.elc .elc.gz
          .elc.bz2 ...). This would improve the speed a lot. To make it
          possible, it would be necessary to distinguish between the
          format of the cache generated by the perl program and the one
          generated by tinypath itself and trigger only the code specific
          to the format used. It is no convenient to treat both formats of
          the cache with the same code, because you lost the advantages
          that you can obtain with the perl program.
          <New cache code addresses this.>

2001-02-28 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinytab.el: Added `tinytab-version' to display the documentation.

        * tinypath.el:

        (tinypath-cache-setup): Serious error: 1) load saved cache,
        which defined empty load-path 2) ..this is detected and the EXT
        process reads new setup 3) BUT, this setup is never saved! Next
        time the old cache file is still loaded with empty load-path
        and the EXT runs again... Fixed.
        (tinypath-tmp-find-writable-dir): `root-user-p' test must not be done
        in Win32.

        * load-path.el

2000-12-21 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymail.el (tinymail-from-set-field): Added more
        debugging info for spotting troubles in generating the
        From: field.

        * tinyeat.el (ti::-fmacro-version-bug-report): Wrong
        and old id 'tie' changed to 'tinyeat'.

        * tinymbx.el (tinymbx-mode): Define keys to root map when
        echo-area-menu is used too.
        (tinymbx-header-hide): If buffer is read only,
        handle text properties correctly.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-info-files-in-directory): 1.32
        Rearranged matching the info files as suggested in patch by
        Luis Miguel Hernanz Iglesias <luish@germinus.com>
        (tinypath-info-directory-contents-update): 1.32 The default
        DIR installation adds sentence where the directory is announced
        for the DIR file. This however sometimes conflicts
        with the search, because the path includes word '/gnus/' and
        the infofile is also named 'gnus'. Added extra code to drop away
        the mismatch. Bug fond by
        Luis Miguel Hernanz Iglesias <luish@germinus.com>

        * tinylib.el:
        (ti::b-replace-keywords-with-table): 1.28 New by
        Colin Walters <walters+n@cis.ohio-state.edu>

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-read-word-module): 1.32 New.
        (tinyperl-ask-module): 1.32 REad the possible module name
        under point when you call C-c ' p `tinyperl-pod-by-module'

2000-12-20 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyeat.el (tinyeat-install-default-bindings): Added
        (kbd ESC DEL). The escape backspace was not otherwise recognized
        under SunOS/Exceed-PC connection.

2000-12-19 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * comint.el (comint-dynamic-complete-as-filename-1): was
        `comint-dynamic-complete-as-filename'
        (comint-dynamic-complete-as-filename): New. The completion
        fails to see the changed directory if user calls an shell alias to
        change the directory. The path however will show the changed
        location. This function calls dirtrack (if available) to make
        a second guess before giving up.

2000-12-18 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinydired.el (tinydired-switch-to-ange-ftp-buffer): 1.11
        first time tested in Win32/Cygwin and the multiple
        mget seems to still work! Added `use-prefix-key' `C-c', but
        this really need to be converted to use minor mode map.

        Don't you want COMMAND.COM, 4DOS.COM, 4NT.EXE, and NDOS.EXE to be

        I think your regexps are dangerously unsafe: they match "//foo" and
        "/cygdrive/foo/bar", for example.  This will be especially annoying on
        Unix, if someone happens to hit these magic file names (since the call
        to dirtrack-path-to-standard is unconditional).  But even on a DOSish
        system this could bite someone, as nothing prevents a naive user from
        creating a /cygdrive directory, even if Cygwin is not installed.

        I think you need to make sure there's a single drive letter there,
        followed by a slash, and also that the drive letter is in the [A-Za-z]
        range.  And even then, this should not be called on anything but
        ms-dos and windows-nt systems.

        * w32-fns.el (w32-cygwin-path-to-dos): New.

        * dirtrack.el (dirtrack-path-to-standard): Fixed the
        regexps to be more accurate. Require [a-z] drive letter
        after cygwin paths. Anchored to the beginning.
        (dirtrack-path-to-standard): Moved to w32-fns.el
        (dirtrack): Call `w32-cygwin-path-to-dos'.

        * comint.el (comint-directory-sep-char): Changed to use
        `w32-system-shell-p' to check if running under DOS type
        command shell.

        * tinyad.el (shell): 1.11 Asks id a new shell is created when
        you call M-x shell. To change to existing shell without asking,
        prefer `switch-to-buffer' or `iswitchb.el'

        * tinylisp.el (tinylisp-find-buffer-local-variables): 1.24
        Fixed the print layout. Listing local variables that are lists
        are now printed in separate line.

2000-12-14 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinytf.el (tinytf-text-format-p): 1.30 Incorect regex to
        detect TF styled text buffer. Only detected files that had numbered
        heading, not files without numbers.

        Sent patch to FSF regarding better completion support for Cygwin and
        DOS buffers.

        * dirtrack.el (dirtrack): Call `dirtrack-path-to-standard'
        (dirtrack-path-to-standard): New. When running Cygwin inside
        NTEmacs, the ptah name can be  //c/temp  or /cygdrive/d/temp. This
        function converts them to understandable c:/temp which can
        be tested with `file-accessible-directory-p' in function
        `dirtrack'

        * comint.el (comint-directory-sep-char): New.
        Added w32 support for completing directorynames with \
        in the comint shell buffer when `comint-completion-addsuffix'
        was set to true.
        (comint-dynamic-complete-as-filename): Call `comint-directory-sep-char'

        sos based shell named like cmd.*\\.exe

        * tinyeat.el (tinyeat-:non-word-chars): 1.7 Win32 fix.
        When eating the filename, the kill didn't stop at backslash.
        Now it correctly kills elements inside e:\dir\here\file.txt

2000-12-13    <jaalto@cs.tpu.fi>

        * tinyload.el (tinyload-:idle-time): Increased
        load interval, because the interval is too short for
        long load times.
        (tinyload-start): Added missing `interactive'. This
        is user callable function.

2000-12-13 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyeat.el
        overall docs: Changed it to 3rd person voice.
        (tinyeat-zap-line): 1.6 Documentation: mention
        that the whole line, including newline is killed in one shot.

2000-12-12 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymail.el (tinymail-message-disable-sender): 1.25
        This function broke if Gnus group buffer called the agent send
        command bound to J S key. Added an extra check for
        `message-syntax-checks'
        (tinymail-post-command-1): 1.25 Moved
        `tinymail-field-cc-kill-by-regexp' out of the header size
        check. For some reason it was not called. have
        to investigate later for more.

2000-12-11 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinytf.el: 1.29 Added Win32 paths, UNC \\machine\dir and
        c:\windows\dir and c:/windows/dir. Suggested by
        david x callaway <dxc@xprt.net>
        (tinytf-mode): 1.29 Moved the menus MODE OFF and MODE HELP
        to the top level. Fixed bug where the `tinytab-mode' did't
        follow the TF mode turn off/on. If user had turned on tab mode
        prior turning TF mode, the tab mode must stay on when TF is
        turned off.

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-file-stamp): 1.20 This function did not
        stamp the RCS identifiers. The match was lost to function
        `ti::s-sqz'. Wrapped the code in `save-match-data'

        * tinylisp.el (tinylisp-call-at-point): 1.22
        Added `shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer'

        * tinyad.el
        -- Changed all dates to ISO 8601 format
        -- Remaining old TIAD texts changed to TinyAd
        (tinyad-:advice-table): 1.9 `fill-paragraph'
        regexp fixed. The advice shoud be activated only in Emacs
        19.20 - 19.28
        (tinyad-install): 1.9 Moved after `tinyad-ad-function-list',
        because function should be defined before called.
        (exchange-point-and-mark): 1.10 Added `interactive-p' test.
        which solved serious problem  with `viper-mode' reported by
        david x callaway <dxc@xprt.net>

        File names changes. In order to use the lisp databases, append
        `-flag' to the names. Like if you want to rell where the system
        wide site-lisp location is, add to the root file
        `site-lisp-flag.el'

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-report-mode): 1.29 Moved
        font lock here.
        (tinypath-report-mode-font-lock): 1.29 Renamed. Was
        `tinypath-font-lock'

        Improvements to perl module page fontification what you
        access via C-c ' p  File::Find.pm

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-install): 1.19 Use `add-hooks` NOT `add-hook'
        for 'write-file-hooks

        crypt++.el support. Keep hooks in right order.
        (add-hooks): 1.26 New.

2000-12-08 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyload.el (tinyload-cancel): New.
        (tinyload-start): New.
        (tinyload-loader-process): Added better debug messages.
        Added `condition-case' stateemnts to protect the BEFORE and
        AFTER eval statements when the package is loaded.
        Serious correction: There was `sit-for' that that threw the
        control back to user if sit-for couldn't be waited. BUT,
        the process didn't clear the busy count => eternal deadlock
        situation.
        (tinyload-feature-p): This function generated error, because the
        string-match didn't look into string `feature', but buffer. I
        don't undertand how on earth tinyload.el package has worked
        and I haven't have notticed this error. This was the source of
        continuous deadlock in Linux Redhat Emacs 20.7

2000-12-08  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-mouse-movement-handler): Added safeguards
        so that functions `posn-window' and `event-start' exist
        and that `win' pointer gets defined.
        (tinymy-buffer-info): Added support for dired buffers. Point
        at the end of dired buffer to see the information.

2000-12-06 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylibm.el (font-lock-mode-maybe): 1.25 Wrong font-lock
        variable test `fboundp'. Changed to `boundp'
        (colours-supported-p): 1.25 Added Emacs 21 test, which
        is supposed to have colors in tty.

        * tinyliba.el: 1.17 Removed autoload for
        `global-font-lock-mode', because win32 21.2 XEmacs didn't
        have it. I may have had old xemacs-packages (sumo)
        (locate-library): 1.17 Added XEmacs overlay.el autoloads

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-report-mode-default-bindings): 1.28
        Xemacs trouble: Wrong modifier `shiftt' corrected.

        * tinymail.el (tinymail-post-command-1): 1.24 Added
        `remove-properties' to read the field contents.

        * tinylisp.el (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): 1.21 Win32 fix. The
        end of line included \r character. Didn't find variables of function
        from the same file if it included Win32 line-endings.

        * tinyhotlist.el
        Corrected some typos in the setup.
        (tinyhotlist-set-defaults): 1.7 New.
        (tinyhotlist-control): 1.7 Call `tinyhotlist-set-defaults' if
        prefix argument is 9
        (tinyhotlist-control): 1.7 Added code to initialize the hotlist
        if it was nil. User must have set the variable
        `tinyhotlist-:default-regexp'
        (tinyhotlist-:abbreviate-file-name-table): 1.7 Win32 fix.
        The HOME path is seen in lowercase by function
        `tinyhotlist-abbreviate-file-name' as returned from
        (buffer-file-name)
        (tinyhotlist-build-default-hotlist): 1.7 New.
        (tinyhotlist-add-internal): Make the hotlist string entries
        prettier. Not the buffer names and file locations are lined up
        with `format' (UPDATE) Spoke too soon. The popup font is not
        monospaced in win32, so the entries are nto lined up. But at
        least they are separated.


2000-12-05 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyliby.el (ti::y-get-file-documentation): 1.12 Added support
        for defadvice functions.

        * tinyad.el: 1.8 Only textual correction `tinyad' => `TinyAd'
        (vc-mode-line): 1.8 Before doing anything, make sure that the
        actual RCS file exists.

        * tinytf.el (tinytf-install-hooks): 1.28 It was wrong
        to test the variable `tinytf-:idle-timer-elt', because it
        may have been accidentally set to nil. Moved code out of
        the `when' test. Bug reported by Luis Miguel Hernanz
        Iglesias <luish@ieeesb.etsit.upm.es>

        * tinydiff.el (tinydiff-file-to-patch): 1.13 Added `Refence' to
        function documentation.
        (tinydiff-diff-command-generate): 1.13 Record command
        line prompt to *Messages* buffer
        (tinydiff-patch-with-diff-1): 1.13 Record command
        line prompt to *Messages* buffer

        * tinytf.el (tinytf-text-format-file-p): 1.27 Too many accidents:
        TF mode was turned on for Perl /C++ buffers etc. A new function
        will now require that the file extension must be standard .txt
        before any TF is searched for.
        (tinytf-:tinytf-mode-p-function): 1.27 Set to
        `tinytf-text-format-file-p' instead of `tinytf-text-format-p'

        * tinytab.el (tinytab-mode): 1.10 Added missing CONTROL META
        TAB to unintend region and SHIFT ISO-LEFTTAB to unintend line.
        Thanks to david x callaway <dxc@xprt.net>

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-info-directory-contents-update): 1.27
        If we read /usr/local/info and we're not root, then
        this buffer will be read only. make it writable. The
        save error is handled elswhere.

        * tinytf.el (tinytf-:mode-define-keys-hook): 1.26
        Do not set this variable if it's already set by user. For example
        user may not like the Function kayes and the hook may
        contains his own settings.

        * tinytab.el (tinytab-mode): 1.8 Added alt shift iso-lefttab
        for Linux to indent region back.

        * tinytf.el (tinytf-exit): 1.25 Added `interactive' The
        'zx' mode command died. Bug reported by david x callaway
        <dxc@octopus.hf.intel.com>
        (tinytf-text-format-p): 1.25 Now you can call this
        fuction interactively to check if buffer is found to
        be in TF mode. If file is loaded and it is though to be in
        TF mode, this may be false assumption and the regexp must be
        made better. To debug the situation, run this function.

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-build-list-of-inc-files):
        Say `@INC', not just `INC'

        (tinypath-cache-regenerate): 1.26 Call also
        `tinypath-info-scan-Info-default-directory-list'.
        (tinypath-:info-file-basic-contents): The format changed.
        Surround everything with double quotes, because CVS in win32
        stucks the line endings with \r\n. the only way to prevent this
        is to write everything in double quotes and adding \n at the end.

        * tinylib.el (ti::m-rcs-delta-lock-status): 1.27 The `while'
        `looking-at' loop causes Emacs to exhaust the whole memory.
        Used `re-search-forward' instead. Bug reported and traced by
        Sami Khoury <skhoury@omnisig.com>

        * tinycompile.el (default-value): 1.8 For some reason the
        `tinycompile-mode' value was set to t, although I did not
        find any reference from the code why it got set. Added piece
        of code to the end to ensure the global was is nil.

        * tinyigrep.el (tinyigrep-guess): 1.13 Removed `no-ask'
        argument from `save-some-buffers'. Commented the saving completely
        so that no extra questions are asked.

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-default-mark-table): 1.19 Now marks
        Perl compiler lines too. The spec for `non-spc' included a
        colon, wich is legimate character in win32 for E:/some/dir.

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-file-stamp): 1.16 Check the old value and
        compare it to the current. Only if the value is different, stamp

2000-11-18 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinytf.el (tinytf-bullet-format): 1.23 Added `+'
        as valid bullet marker to search. Mistakenly required empty
        space at front of bullet before detecting bullet.

        -- Copied the necessary code from libraries here to make the package
           self standing as much as possible. (This is the only time I see a reason
           to have a second copy of a function somewhere else).

        * tinymail.el
        BIG CHANGES: The completion structure has undergone an
        upgrade. The old method was to call separate functions that
        asked questions whether user wanted to complete or not
        and then move to next function/question. This lead to unconvenient
        proceed/cance-completion/maybe-it's-in-next-one syndrome.
        Instead I wanted that the completiosn were gathered to one big
        list first and the TAB key would off all possible choices
        at once.  This seems to be more intuitive. The old behavior is
        still available if you manually set the variable as follows.
        The top two of the functions have been replaced by single
        function `tinymail-complete-everything'

        (setq tinymail-install-hooks
        '(tinymail-complete-bbdb-fuzzy
          tinymail-complete-guess-in-headers

        (tinymail-field-cc-kill-by-regexp):
        New user function. Deletes email
        addresses matching regexp from the CC field. This is handy
        if you compose message and you don't want CC copy. Set 'CC:  '
        (two spaces) and the CC field is NOT TOUCHED.

        (emacs-pp): Obsolete. Too 20.x specific and 21.x is
        around the corner. Use (emacs-p "20.0") if you want backward
        compatibility.
        (xemacs-pp): Obsolete. Removed. Use `xemacs-pp' instead.

        * tinyigrep.el (tinyigrep-install-default-databases): 1.12
        Emacs 20.6 No longer distributes CL.EL in directory
        /emacs-version/cl.el but in /emacs-version/emacs-lisp/cl.el
        --> corrected database searches `lisp-emacs-distribution'
        and `lisp-cl'

2000-07-27 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-scroll): 1.13 A little inconsistency
        in movement since last changes: after scrolling cursor up,
        keep the cursor at the top line.

2000-07-26 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-pod-write-skeleton-module-function): 1.13

        have trailing space when stamped. Corrected.

        * tinygnus.el (tinygnus-summary-mode): 1.11 Removed
        C-^  and C-\  bindings, because they are not in very good
        places for every keyboard. Left alone the Alt-r and Alt-s
        which vere equivalent. I Suggest that you define the FAST search
        commands in the `tinygnus-summary-mode-hook'
        using `tinygnus-:summary-mode-map' for
        `tinygnus-gnus-summary-search-article-forward' and `backward'

2000-07-25 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * other/folding.el (ada-mode): 2.75 Added support for modes:
        xrdb-mode, ksh-mode and sql-mode contributed by
        Juhapekka Tolvanen <juhtolv@st.jyu.fi>. Scanned systematically

        Bound to key "I"

        Mode marked with (*) was not added.

2000-07-24 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-pod-write-mode): 1.13 scrool-up and
        scroll-down are now defined in `root-map', not in C-c . map.
        (tinyperl-pod-write-skeleton-script-manpage): 1.13 Added
        --test option and PREREQUISITES to help() manpage template.

2000-07-23 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-scroll): 1.13 Rewritten. Now uses
        `move-to-window-line'. Revert to old implementation if this
        function does not exist.

2000-07-13 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylisp.el (tinylisp-library-locate): 1.13
        Prefix argument insert the filenames to the current point.
        Try e.g. finding "gnus.el" in your system.
        (tinylisp-library-load-by-regexp): 1.13 Error in the code.
        Reload of e.g. "jde" failed.

2000-06-06 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymail.el (tinymail-report-mail-install): 1.14 Added
        verbose message 'TinyMail: Report mail feature has
        been turned [on|off]'

        (tinymail-report-mail-install): 1.14 Added arg VERB
        (turn-on-tinymail-report-mail): 1.14 Added arg VERB
        (turn-off-tinymail-report-mail): 1.14 Added arg VERB

        * tinymy.el
        Use `locate-library' to check autorevert.el
        (tinymy-:mail-check-inbox-file-permissions): 1.13 Removed.
        (tinymy-mail-lock-check): 1.13 Removed.

        * tinylisp.el (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): 1.13 Added `fset'

        KIT RELEASED 1999-06-05 UTC+2 11.30
        -- Win32 XEmacs 21.2.20 changes to many packages: tinyperl.el,
           tinyurl.el
        -- More compatible timer/idel timer support functions in libraries.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-non-existing-directory-list): 1.10
        Added missing `path' variable. Byte compiler error.

2000-06-04 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinylisp.el: 1.12 Added `apropos-mode-hook', so that it is easy to
        jump to the variable and function definitions with $ ' (tinylisp-mode
        is turned on). Submitted patch to FSF to add missing apropos-mode-hook,
        and `apropos-after-hook'. Until then the `appropos-mode' is defadvised.

2000-06-03 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-find-file-hook): 1.12 Don't use setq
        to turn on mode, call `turn-on-tinyurl-mode-1'

        * tinylibm.el (use-tmp-file): 1.11 respect
        `temporary-file-directory' and fallback to c:/temp too in addition
        to /tmp

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-package-save-to-file): 1.12 When calling C-z x f
        to save lisp package from a newsgroup article to a file, the
        generated end string had full path name '/dir/dir/dir/file.el ends here'
        Now only take the name part and append line 'file.el ends here'
        (tinymy-flip-windows): 1.12 Rewritten.

2000-06-02 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyload.el (tinyload-:idle-time): 1.5 Changed the scanning time
        from 10 --> 15, because some packages too too much to load and a new
        timer process got launched.

2000-06-01 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymy.el (tinymy-package-save-to-file): 1.12 If 'end-str' was nil,
        the save died. Fixed.

        * tinylibb.el (char-to-int): 1.8 mistakenly had `defalias' must
        use `defalias-maybe'

        * tinylibm.el (idle-timer-supported-p): 1.11 New. Win32 ZEmacs does
        not have reliable idle timers.

        * tinytag.el (tinytag-word-at-point): 1.7 was `tinytag-pick-word'
        (tinytag-word-default-adjust): 1.7 Wrong search rtegexp generated for
        JAVA. For example word "System.out.println" was classified as
        'Syste.out.*println\>\\|println' and of course second 'println' always
        wins. Removed the second alternative.
        (tinytag-install): 1.7 Call `idle-timer-supported-p'

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-install-hooks): 1.12
        XEmacs fix. Added `cperl-mode-hook`
        (tinyperl-:pod-font-lock-keywords): 1.12 XEmacs fix.
        Added Win32 \r next to \n characters in regular expressions.

        * tinytf.el (turn-on-tinytf-mode-maybe): 1.8 was
        `tinytf-mode-turn-on-maybe'

        * tinylib.el (ti::xe-mouse-key): 1.14 XEmacs fix.Can't use use `concat'
        to make a string from int. Used format. (TinyUrl mouse-2 keypress died.)

        (tinyurl-install): 1.12 Win32 XEmacs 21.1.x does have idle timer
        emulation, but THEY DON'T WORK. Added a check that Win32 XEmacs must
        be version 21.2 or higher to use idle timers. Uses post command
        hook until that, which is not a good overall solution.
        Inactivity reported by Bruce Ingalls <bruce@conde-dev.com>
        (tinyurl-install): 1.12 Use `idle-timer-supported-p'

        * tinyliba.el: (emacs-debug-mode) 1.11 New user function.

        * tinymail.el (tinymail-:complete-bbdb-case-fold-search): 1.13
        New user variable. Now you can have case sensitive BBDB completions.
        (ti::m-fmacro-version-bug-report): 1.13 Now return Timer information.
        (tinymail-:password-file): 1.13 Do not save to the HOME directory

        the correct location.

        * tinylisp.el (tinylisp-jump-to-definition): 1.12 Now generates error
        if can't fins absolute path. Check also if there is only compiled
        file and refuse to jump to it.

        * tinyliby.el (ti::y-lh-where-is-source): 1.9 Didn't return absolute
        path name. Now call (ti::y-package-where-is-source  file) if provide
        was nto found.

        * tinypath.el
        -- Added note about tinylisp.el and how to locate a Emacs package.
        (tinypath-direcectory-lisp-p): 1.10 Returned t only
        if found an .el file, but there could eb solely compiled files
        that end to .elc. Check that too.
        (tinypath-find-dir): 1.10 Do not use CONCAT '/', but more general
        `file-name-as-directory' which will add missing / if any.
        (tinypath-cache-file-old-p): 1.10 Renamed from `tinypath-cache-old-p'
        (tinypath-subdirectory-list): 1.10 was `tinypath-subdirectories'

        Previously returned the ROOT if no subdirs were found.
        (tinypath-add-directory-one): 1.10 was `tinypath-add-directories-1'
        (tinypath-add-directory-many): 1.10 was `tinypath-add-directories'
        (tinypath-:load-path-ignore-regexp): 1.10 Removed 'misc', because that
        can be valid directory name. More strict 'tex$', because
        it matched good dir namex 'text'
        (tinypath-:load-path-root): 1.10 mistakenly defconst. Changed to defvar.


2000-05-25 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        A better error message if the shellex.exe is not present.
        Old Emacs version has a bug where `find-executable' does not
        search .exe, work around it.

        * tinycompile.el: 1.6 Added missing folding mark. Thanks to
        dxc@xprt.net

2000-05-09 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinymail.el (tinymail-report-install): 1.13 The timer process
        was installed according to stred `tinymail-:report-timer-object', but
        it is more robust to use `ti::xe-timer-cancel-function' to kill
        the `tinymail-report-update'. `tinymail-:report-timer-object is no
        longer used for anything else, but for a reference.
        (tinymail-report-mail-install): 1.13 Renamed from `tinymail-report-install'
        (tinymail-report-mail-install-maybe): 1.13 Renamed from `tinymail-report-install-maybe'

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-tmp-find-writable-dir): 1.10 New. Find
        writable directory by trying. This only sets the initial values
        for  `tinypath-:cache-file-prefix' `tinypath-:load-path-dump-file'.
        If you drop the Emacs to NT Network drive which is not writable,
        this hopefully finds a suitable "TEMP" directory where to store
        the cache.
        (tinypath-:cache-file-prefix): 1.10 use `tinypath-tmp-find-writable-dir'
        (tinypath-:load-path-dump-file): 1.10 use `tinypath-tmp-find-writable-dir'

        nil, fixed.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-non-existing-directory-list): 1.10 New.
        (tinypath-cache-non-existing-list): 1.10 Renamed to
        `tinypath-cache-non-existing-file-list'
        (tinypath-install-timer): 1.10 New. Add timer to watch if
        cacahe becomes out of date. Of if entry in load-path does not
        exist eny more (moved directories). This should provide automatic
        detection of changes, provided that you leave your Emacs idle for more
        that 15 minutes.

        * tinyscroll.el (tinyscroll-timer-process-control): 1.6 rewritten,
        use `ti::xe-timer-control'

        * tinylib.el (ti::xe-timer-control): 1.14 New.
        (ti::xe-timer-elt): 1.14 Rewritten. Search also `timer-idle-list'.
        Now returns '(timer-elt timer-variable) instead of plain timer-elt.

        FUNCTION.

        * tinytf.el ("tinytf-"): 1.8 Removed unnecessary keybinding
        z w ` (backtick). That was incorrectly listed in Menu bar as

2000-03-20 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-plugged-always-p): 1.12 New. Foe users

        less than 20, the `ti::xe-popup' was called with wrong conversion
        function `cdr'. This caused Signaling: (wrong-type-argument stringp 36)
        popup-menu(...) Corrected to `car'. Error reported by
        Dr. Volker Zell <vzell@de.oracle.com>
        (tinytf-idle-command): 1.6 prefer `post-command-idle-hook' if it exists
        (tinytf-install-hooks): 1.6 Double check that

        -- XEmacs and Emacs byte compiler errors cleaned.

        * tinypair.el (minibuffer-setup-hook): 1.9 Disabled
        pairing in minibuffers. Tinypair overlaps with tinyef.el when you
        compose filename, e.g you can't step-delete back with "[" or some other
        pairing keys that might be mapped to tinyef.el as well.
        (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook 'turn-off-tinypair-mode)

        gives clue what version of Gnus is currently used. The package works
        only with latest Gnus version (5.8.3+)
        (tinygnus-fix-nnml-groups): 1.10 Added missing variable `group'

        * tinyperl.el (turn-on-tinyperl-mode-all-buffers): 1.11
        Byte compiler fix: Corrected variable name `tinyperl-:mode'

        * tinylib.el: 1.13 Added missing autoloads for couple of
        vc-hooks.el functions.
        XEmacs 21.1 compile fix: The ange-ftp is
        not loaded, because it has conflicting key bindings. This means
        that library will produce following compile tim errors, which
        CAN BE SAFELY IGNORED:
          ** The following functions are not known to be defined:
             ange-ftp-ftp-name, ange-ftp-get-process,
             ange-ftp-process-handle-line,
             ange-ftp-real-file-name-as-directory, ange-ftp-expand-dir,
             ange-ftp-ftp-process-buffer, ange-ftp-set-binary-mode,

        * tinylibm.el: 1.10 to Support old Emacs versions that do not
        come custom.el bundled, there is an emulation included. However, this
        part of the code belongs to the "b" (backward compatibility) library.

2000-02-16 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-default-mark-table): 1.11 fixed ange-ftp

        (tinyurl-validate-url): 1.11 Corrected ange-ftp check. Must return
        t. Returned NUMBER, which is not correct and caused rejection
        of all ange-ftp urls.

2000-02-15 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyperl.el (turn-on-tinyperl-mode-all-buffers): 1.11 New.
        Automatic mode install to all perl buffers when file loads.
        (tinyperl-variable-convert): 1.11 New.
        (tinyperl-install): 1.11 More robust install. Now using the FORCE
        (C-u) tries to recover from accident where the cache file has read
        following perl executable definition:
           (defconst tinyperl-:perl-bin
               "e:\USR\LOCAL\BIN\PERL\BIN\perl.exe")
        Of Course Emacs sees this as e:USRLOCALBINPERLBINperl.exe and the
        catastrophy is ready. Now the tinyperl-:perl-bin is restored if
        possible.
        (tinyperl-executable-find-path): 1.11 New.
        (tinyperl-pod-by-module): 1.11 Made regexp more strict. Eg If you
        searched HTTP::Response manpage, it mistakenly showed a text
        "HTTP::Response" in previous document that was in the
        buffer already, and dind't load the full HTTP::Response manpage.

        * tinydiff.el (tinydiff-patch): 1.11 Removed `shell-execute' and
        used `call-process'. Win32 fix.

        * tinylisp.el: 1.11 `use-package-view' moved after library load statement.
        Flagged: ** the function use-package-view is not known to be defined.

        * other/folding.el (folding-event-posn): 2.70 Wrong
        place of paren and the following was malformed call:
        (let* ((el (funcall (symbol-function 'event-start) event)))


        * tinypgp.el (message): 1.8 Added Note at compile time that
        this file is not maintained currently. Maybe at Summer 2000.

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-cache-non-exist-report): 1.8 PMAX is
        not defined when this file loads. Fixed.

        * tinygnus.el: TinyGnus works only with latest Gnus,
        check the version number and print warnign if i is not correct.

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-inc-path): 1.10 Extra variable `cmd'
        removed.

        * tinyezip.el (error): 1.5 Added missing "\" at the end of
        "** TinyEzip is being phased out...."

        * tinyliba.el (kill-buffer-safe): 1.10 Added autoload for
        `kill-buffer-safe' because it wasn't found at compile time
        (makefile.pl). This still puzzles me, because all the libs include
        tinylibm.el which defines the function?

2000-02-07 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-:win32-shell-execute-helper): 1.10
        Added XEmacs 21.2 `mswindows-shell-execute' support. shellex.el is not
        required in Emacs 20.4 and XEmacs 21.2 any more.
        C-code implemented by Fabrice Popineau 2000-02-05

        names. (Hit ESC-C by accident?)

        * tinygnus.el (tinygnus-summary-gather-urls): 1.9 Fixed
        documentation string.
        (tinygnus-summary-gather-urls): 1.9 Added `total'

        * tinyperl.el (tinyperl-install): 1.10 Convert all path names to
        Unix format. When cache saved the state, the backslashes caused problem
        in win32, because the variables were saved as:
        (defconst tinyperl-:perl-bin
           "e:\USR\LOCAL\BIN\PERL\BIN\perl.exe")
        Which of course gets messed up when loaded (I would have needed
        double backslashes).

2000-01-24 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyigrep.el (tinyigrep-install-default-databases): 1.10 Added
        dtabase "lisp-jde"

        * tinypad.el ("tinypad-"): 1.4 Key definition went to wrong keymap.
        They dind]t show up in the global map, so that Alt-F didn't accesss
        the "File" menu. Fixed. The Mode help didn't display the key settings.
        Fixed.

2000-01-23 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinypath.el (tinypath-:cache-file-postfix): 1.8
        Check if gzip exists. Only then use compressed cache (.el.gz)
        This is Win32 fix.

2000-01-18 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-type): 1.10 Added detection of www.some.com
        URLs. Anything that starts with `www'

        * tinylisp.el ("tinylisp-"): 1.11 Menu items rearranged

        * tinydired.el (tinydired-normal-buffer-p): 1.8 Vadim Egorov
        <egorovv@1c.ru> sent patch to fix the Dired's first line
        recognition. "I encountered a problem with tinydired - it doesn't
        keep dirs because it doesn't consider dired buffer 'normal' I had
        to fix it this way :". Patch applied as is.

        * other/folding.el (folding-bind-default-mouse): 2.68 XEmacs and
        Emacs Mouse bindding was different. Now use commaon bindings: The
        S-mouse-2 was superfluous, because mouse-3 already did that, so
        the binding was removed. mouse-3 folding-mouse-context-sensitive
        S-mouse-2 folding-hide-current-entry C-S-mouse-2
        folding-mouse-pick-move
        (folding-mark-look-at): feature not not enabled
        2.69 The `looking-at' is now smarter with
        fold beginning marks. The tradition has been the the fold always
        has a name, so the requirement to search fold is "{{{ ". Now
        the " " is searched as " *", not requiring a space --> not requiring
        a fold name.
        (folding-skip-folds): Feature is not not enabled.
        2.69 Do not require trailing " " any more.'
        (folding-tidy-inside): Feature is not not enabled.
        2.69 Do not require trailing " " any more.
        (folding-install): 2.69 Fixed indentation.
        (folding-mark-look-at): 2.69 The "em" missed "*" and thus pressing
        mouse-3 at the end-fold dind't collapse the whole fold.


2000-01-12 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-mark-line): 1.10 Made interactive, because
        you usually do: M-x tinyurl-debug-toggle followed by test
        M-x tinyurl-mark-line and M-x tinyurl-debug-show to see the
        results it dind't mark correctly looking url on the line.
        (tinyurl-validate-url-email): 1.10 Wrong return `nil' value in
        default case prevent any EMAIL address to be buttonized. now
        You can click on EMAIL addresses. You could also choose

        (tinyurl-find-url-mail): 1.10 Call `compose-mail' if it exists
        to respect user's `mail-user-agent' setting.
        (tinyurl-:email-regexp): 1.10 Made the email matching regexp
        more sensible and strict to avoid too many mishits.

        work around it by calling 'date-compare-key in dired-sort.el with

        * tinyurl.el (tinyurl-handler): Added `use-non-dedicated-frame'

        (tinydesk-auto-save): 1.7 Check Command line
        arg "-name" for periodic autosave. Do not use Fram name
        any more, because in win32 the frame name reflects the

        * tinylib.el
        The Minor mode generation function had a serious flaw. The prefix key
        that user gave was limited to ""  notation; like "\C-c", but if user
        specified the key in vector notation [(symbol)] then it broke. It was due
        to using too simplistic (concat prefix key) approach.
        This was replaced by defining a completely separate PREFIX-MAP where
        keybindings were put and the preix key that accesses the mode
        map is connected to it by call:
           (define-key mode-map mode-prefix-key mode-prefix-map)
        (ti::m-fmacro-define-keys-1): Added `mode-prefix-map'
        Call `ti::k-single-key-definition-p'
