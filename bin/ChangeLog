        files were available with extension .txt. This is Geocities
        limitation. Replace the section with more smarter and adaptive
        url fetch code. Previously used direct urls to load, nut
        if user put more .txt files, they should have been manually

        new files.
        (bakel-tijs): Wrong directory, /pub => /pub/elisp
        (id3): Wrong pregexp => Changed to id3el-0.*.tar.gz

        Accept bare labels -dos, -unix as conversion options too.

        or unix depending on the operating system. If user passed
        the path name in UNIX format under cygwin (completion), it
        must be converted into DOS format, because SYSTEM() is run
        in DOS context.

2001-08-13 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * mywebget-emacs.conf: 1.34 `storm-kim' site changed. updated

2001-07-02  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * makefile.pl (SfUploadIncoming): New function to help
        upload release packages to Sourceforge.

2001-05-17 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * makefile.pl (Html): 1.44 readdir() regular expression picked
        up .pl files for html generation. Added NOT .pl regexp to exclude
        perl files.

2001-04-11 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        (sub TargetClean): 1.41 Added Celaning autoload files.

2001-03-20 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * makefile.pl (sub Autoload): Default value `emacs' and `xemacs'
        didn't work well. The FindBinary function didn't receive the
        argument. Fixed.

2001-03-13 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * makefile.pl: Removed `autouse' statements, because they seem
        to confuse some perl versions with messages:
        import errors at /usr/local/lib/perl5/autouse.pm. The startup
        time is slightly higher with all modules loaded with `use', but
        that is insignificant.
        (Autoload): Removed `die' command, because it is not strictly
        necessary to give target emacs with --binary, since the autoload
        file generation is same in Emacs and XEmacs. (I hope).

2001-03-09 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * makefile.pl (sub HandleCommandLineArgs): Added BUTTON_PREVIOUS
        and BUTTON_NEXT --button_previous etc.

        seratate IF test cases.
